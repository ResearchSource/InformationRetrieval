Most\ntarget affluent consumers by emphasizing efficiency and time\nmanagement, as well as home and hearth.\n   The businesses feed off demographic and cultural shifts\nthat are likely to shape the 1990s. Women who cleaned up\nafter the family a generation ago are out working. The number\nof households is increasing as average household size\nshrinks, meaning more but smaller residences. And as a\nsociety, Americans are probably the most acquisitive people\nin history.\n   \"We're in an accumulation mode that knows no bounds,\" says\nStephanie Culp, an organizing consultant and a founding\nmember of the National Association of Professional\nOrganizers. \"So people find themselves in a terrible space\ncrunch.\"\n   Hold Everything, a retail and catalog seller of organizing\ngoods, plans an ambitious national expansion this year. Kent\nC. Larson, president of Williams-Sonoma Inc., the San\nFrancisco kitchenware merchant that owns the business,\nattributes the boom in part to soaring real estate prices and\na tendency for people to entertain and relax at home. Hold\nEverything, which started as a small catalog in 1982, plans\nto open stores in New York, Washington and other Eastern\ncities to complement its expanding chain in the West.\n   The nascent organizing business is also taking advantage\nof a retailing shift. Much of what they stock is designed to\ncomplement personal computers, electronic entertainment\ncomponents and other modern inventions. But other goods are\nlow-tech housekeeping staples from the 1940s and 1950s, such\nas coated wire cupboard shelves and sweater drying racks --\nitems once found in department store notions sections, dry\ngoods stores and five-and-dime stores, which have virtually\ndied out in many areas of the country.\n   Maynard Hale Lyndon and Lu Wendel Lyndon, architectural\ndesign specialists, say much has changed since they founded\nthe Placewares chain in Boston in 1977. Consumers are more\ninterested in recycling and efficient use of resources, Mr.\nLyndon says, and American manufacturers are finally producing\nquality products once exclusively designed in Europe.\nPlacewares, which just opened it seventh New England store,\nalso sells via catalog and is planning further growth.\n   Lillian Vernon Corp., the specialty catalog concern,\nreports that some of its longtime storage and organization\nitems such as newspaper racks and recycling aids have\nsuddenly surged in popularity.\n   Although the organizing business doesn't have any firm\nstatistics of its own, the National Housewares Manufacturers\nAssociation says the general categories of bath, laundry,\ncloset and storage wares in 1988 accounted for about 4.6% of\nthe $35.2 billion of housewares sales, or a total of about\n$1.62 billion.\n   An organizing store's inventory generally includes\nkitchen, utility room, bathroom, garage and home office\nitems, and occasionally furniture and tableware as well. But\nsome, such as Organizer's Paradise in Los Angeles, take an\neven broader approach, pitching their stores as stylish\noutlets where shoppers can buy anything from modular cupboard\norganizers to a $4,000 electric blue ultrasuede swing settee.\n\"There was a real void in the market for upscale products,\"\nsays Sandy Chism, who along with her daughter, Christi, runs\nthree stores in the fashionable Westwood, Beverly Hills and\nWest Hollywood areas.\n   Merchants who haven't organized their own business plans\nin the new field may find a closet full of problems --\npricing being a big one. Many organization stores offer such\nsticker-shock inducers as $25 plastic sock storage boxes and\n$8 assortments of decorative paper clips.\n   Home-improvement stores, hardware stores and discount\nstores are beginning to stock more organizing items, often at\nprices that specialty stores can't match. The specialty\nstores figure they can overcome the price gap by offering\nhigher quality and better selection and focusing on smaller\norganizing niches.\n   As with any new retailing concept, experts note, targeting\nthe right customers can be crucial to success.\n   \"A retailer is going to have higher sales and faster\n{merchandise turnover} if the focus is on one area,\" says\nMarcia Aaron, a specialty retail analyst with Montgomery\nSecurities in San Francisco. By moving too far into other\nareas such as furniture or other housewares, retailers can\ndilute their customer base.\n   Ms. Aaron says the organizing and storage market has been\nunderserved up to now. \"But there are a lot of people trying\nto get in,\" she says. \"And eventually, some will have to pull\nout because it's just too competitive.\"\n   Retailers say it can be a challenge to make people see a\nneed for organization wares. \"Most people just don't go\naround thinking, `I really need a laundry-room organizer,'\"\nsays a sales clerk at a Los Angeles-area store. \"But once you\nget them in here, you can't get them out.\"\n   Many shoppers agree. \"You get caught up,\" says Mara\nSlutsky of Boston, a customer at Placewares. She bought a\nshower organizer and colored hooks for the bathroom, and says\nshe had to restrain herself from buying \"everything\nimaginable.\"\n   Ms. Slutsky's only criticism of the merchandise is a\ncommon one among several firms' customers: \"After a while,\neverything looks alike,\" she says of the sleek,\nmodern-looking wares. Nonetheless, she says, she plans\nanother shopping spree when she moves to a new apartment.\n   Lori Lavin, a West Los Angeles resident, gushes over the\nmerchandise in a new 13,000-square-foot Organizer's Paradise\nstore as she wheels a wire shopping cart piled with\ncontemporary black desktop items and colorful kitchen\ngadgets. In two visits, she says, she's plunked down more\nthan $130 to update her closets, kitchen and desk. \"I don't\nhave the time to dig through a lot of junk,\" she says of her\ncleanup efforts.\n   That, retailers say, is an important selling point. \"Most\npeople who are space-conscious are time-sensitive as well,\"\nsays Carol Fraser, director of the Hold Everything catalog.\nThe stores tap into the same mentality that has made\nenormous, multisectioned diary planners such a hit.\n   Some say that the merchandise appeals to customers because\nit allows them to attribute their sloppiness to a technical,\nrather than a personal, flaw. \"You're not buying a crutch for\nyour character,\" says Dr. Jerald Jellison, a psychology\nprofessor at the University of Southern California. \"You just\ndon't have the right equipment\" to be neat.", "id": "\n900402-0141.", "title": "\n   Enterprise:\n   Everything Looks in Place\n   For Sellers of Neatness Aids\n   ----\n   By Pauline Yoshihashi\n   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal"}, "doc\n900402-0123.": {"content": "\n   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr.\nDavisson said he contacted Reuter of Hopkins, Minn., earlier\nin the month to ask that the board include a majority of\nindependent directors.

Applied Color Systems Inc. of\nPrinceton, N.J., makes the hardware.\n   In arriving at the perfect color, a designer may make many\nproofs, a task complicated by the fact that ordinary computer\nscreens don't provide an accurate picture of what color will\nlook like in real life. So Barco Inc. of Smyrna, Ga., makes\ncomputer monitors that automatically correct themselves when\ntheir color deviates from true.\n   Someday it may be possible to think a colorful thought,\ntap a few keys and bring up just the right color to match the\nthought. Kuan Kuo, a graduate student at the Illinois\nInstitute of Technology's Institute of Design, has developed\nsoftware that will produce a palette of colors when prompted\nby words such as \"warm\" or \"cool,\" \"hard\" or \"soft,\"\n\"conservative\" or \"liberal.\"\n   Computers certainly have their drawbacks.

Kinder, vice chairman of Enron\nCorp. Another possible buyer says it backed off because it\ndidn't have enough time to examine the extent of\ncontamination, much of which occurred 30 years ago. In the\nend, Coastal lost anyway to a friendly $3.22 billion offer\nfrom Panhandle Eastern Corp. But by then even Panhandle was\nwary.\n   \"You can bet your boots they {the PCBs} were factored into\nour overall examination,\" says Robert Hunsucker, Panhandle's\nchairman. His edgy lenders demanded an outside liability\nestimate before they would finance the bid.\n   Unknown or uncertain environmental liabilities are\nincreasingly shaping acquisitions and takeovers, from\nmultibillion-dollar leveraged buy-outs to the sale of tiny\nstrip malls. They are killing some deals outright, sharply\nraising the price tags of others, and causing still others to\ncrash later on.\n   \"I'm getting a call a month asking me to talk to senior\nexecutives on how to avoid environmental pitfalls in the\n'90s. That never happened before,\" says George Pilko,\npresident of Pilko & Associates Inc., an environmental\nconsultant.\n   Buyers are fearful of hidden cleanup costs, which can\neasily run to $25 million or more. Assuming the new Clean Air\nbill before Congress passes, many companies will soon be\npaying more to contain their own pollution. So the last thing\nthey want is to get saddled with additional costs from an\ninherited toxic dump.\n   They are realizing that this kind of liability can be\nlurking virtually anywhere. In a one-mile circle of downtown\nSan Diego, Environmental Information Systems Inc., a\nconsultant on liabilities, identified more than 400\nenvironmentally risky addresses simply by culling public\nrecords. Included are a soap company, a police station, a\nphotography studio, a jeweler, a bank and a university.\n\"Downtown San Diego is fairly representative of large cities\nin the U.S.,\" says Ronald Miller, the firm's president.\n   Moreover, surprises abound. One recent review of old\naerial photographs -- a standard practice in an environmental\naudit -- turned up a 1920s auto race track about a\nquarter-mile from the famed Beverly Hills Hotel.\nMultimillion-dollar houses now stand where fuel tanks, grease\nand solvents from the track might once have contaminated the\nground, according to Mr. Miller's firm.\n   Dodging the arm of environmental law after the fact is\nincreasingly difficult. A buyer can be held liable even if he\ndidn't own or operate the property at the time of\ncontamination and, needless to say, former owners can be sued\neven if they unloaded the property long ago. To help\ninvestors avoid getting blindsided, the Securities and\nExchange Commission recently told companies to be more\nforthcoming about environmental liabilities, and the EPA is\nhanding over data on hazardous sites to help the commission\ncross-check disclosures.\n   \"Negotiations over environmental issues take more time\nthan any other single point,\" says Gordon Cain, chairman of\nthe Houston-based leveraged buy-out firm Sterling Group. \"All\nthe sellers want to get rid of as much of the liability as\nthey can and no buyer wants to take it.\"\n   Mr. Cain ought to know. He took part two years ago in what\nhas become something of a landmark deal in the area of\nenvironmental risk. Sterling agreed to buy a former Koppers\nCo. chemical business from Beazer PLC of Britain for $660\nmillion. Beazer pledged to pay for any existing environmental\nproblems, a vital issue because of possible creosote\ncontamination at two dozen Koppers wood-treatment sites.\nSterling estimated the worst-case liability at $600 million.\n   \"We would have lived with that if we had been convinced\nthey {Beazer} were financially able to meet their\nobligation,\" recalls Mr. Cain. But the day before a\ndefinitive agreement was to be signed, Sterling pulled out.\n\"We found that Beazer structured its financing so that the\nindemnity to us came after a lot of other obligations,\" he\nsays.\n   Similarly, big asbestos claims pushed Kohlberg Kravis\nRoberts & Co.'s $2.4 billion leveraged buy-out of Jim Walter\nCorp. into bankruptcy court. KKR had known that a Jim Walter\nunit, Celotex Corp., once made asbestos products, but figured\nthat because Celotex was a separate subsidiary, claims could\nbe confined to it. Anyway, Celotex was sold three months\nafter the Jim Walter buy-out was completed.\n   \"They didn't do their homework properly,\" asserts attorney\nStephen D. Susman, who on behalf of 80,000 asbestos victims\nis suing KKR and Hillsborough Holdings Corp., the KKR company\nthat took Jim Walter private. The suit estimates claims of\nover $3 billion. Though KKR and Hillsborough insist the suit\nis without merit, its mere filing so unsettled bond investors\nand potential asset buyers that Hillsborough sought\nbankruptcy court protection in December.\n   On the other hand, knowledge of environmental hazards can\ngive one party an edge in negotiations. \"We see investment\nopportunities where the perceived risk may be greater than\nthe actual risk,\" says Mark Whiting, chief operating officer\nof the Shidler Group, a San Francisco-based real estate\ncompany. When Shidler found asbestos in a Los Angeles office\nbuilding it had offered to buy for $6 million, it cut the bid\nby $1 million. The worried seller, a financial institution,\ngrabbed it. Shidler had privately estimated the cost of\nremoval at only $500,000.\n   Often Mr. Whiting carves a high-risk property out of a\ndeal. Not long ago, after Shidler offered $34 million for 11\nindustrial sites, an environmental consultant reported danger\nsigns at one Danvers, Mass., plant where chlorinated solvents\nhad been used. The consultant found groundwater contamination\nextending beyond the site. \"We kicked the property out of the\ndeal,\" Mr. Whiting says. \"We dodged a bullet.\"\n   As a result of the new risks, more and more bankers are\nrequiring so-called environmental audits before financing\nacquisitions. Some predict such studies will become as\nroutine in takeovers as termite inspections in house sales.\nWhat is different is that environmental liabilities can't\nalways be quantified. Sometimes they can't even be found.\n\"The problem is that you're guessing,\" says Susan Lintott, a\nmanaging director of Chase Manhattan Bank in New York.\n   A suit against State Street Bank of Boston related to a\nNew England waste site particularly worries bankers who fear\nit could set a precedent. Plaintiffs argue the bank is liable\nbecause it in effect became a co-operator of the site while\nattempting to recover a loan from the site's owner. The\nactual operator had filed for bankruptcy protection in 1977.\nState Street doesn't even own the unit that made the loans\nanymore; that was sold in 1983.\n   The notion that a lender may be held liable if it had\nanything to do with a contaminated property even has some\nbanks avoiding foreclosure on overdue debts.\n   Robert G. Wallace and Jack B. Hensley bought the 3.5-acre\nJenson Drive Scrap Yard in Houston a few years ago from\nCharter National Bank for $250,000, financing the deal\nthrough Charter. Six months later, after they couldn't make a\ngo of the business, they tried to sell it, but a prospective\nbuyer's environmental audit revealed widespread PCB\ncontamination. The Environmental Protection Agency condemned\nthe lot and said contact with the soil could be dangerous.\nThe place needed a $10 million cleanup.\n   The men stopped payment on their loan and sued, alleging\nthe bank had known the site was polluted and never told them.\n\"The bank never took any steps to try to recover the note,\"\nsays John Millard, the owners' attorney. \"It's kind of a hot\npotato.\" A lawyer for the bank won't discuss the case except\nto deny the claims against the bank.\n   Many companies carrying environmental liabilities know\nthey have them. Texas Eastern, for example, routinely and\nopenly dumped PCB-laden lubricants into a pit at its pipeline\ncompressor station here. \"That was just the way of doing\nthings,\" recalls Dallas Plumlee, a 20-year veteran employee\nof the company.\n   Pipeline companies first added polychlorinated biphenyls,\nor PCBs, to lubricating oils as a safety measure to prevent\nflash fires in extremely hot compressors. Unfortunately, the\nexceptional stability that makes PCBs a fire retardant also\nmeans they don't break down in the environment. At Texas\nEastern, PCBs leaked through motor seals and down the\npipeline, ultimately contaminating at least 49 sites. By the\n1970s, the potentially adverse health effects of exposure to\nPCBs had become an issue. The EPA banned their manufacture in\n1979.\n   Today, there is little visible evidence of any huge\nliability here amid the pastoral, rolling hills about 20\nmiles from Nashville. The former murky oil-dumping pit is now\ncapped by a grassy knoll, and the company has installed a\nseries of cylindrical storage vats, at $700,000 a set, to\ncatch new waste from the compressor operation.\n   But the oil -- and the PCBs -- must still be removed from\nthe old pit. To that end, Texas Eastern plans to drill half a\ndozen ground-water monitoring wells at $20,000 each to help\ndetermine the extent of the contamination; it expects many\nmore wells will be needed to fully map the location of the\nPCBs.\n   Then there's the matter of removing the contaminated soil.\nSpecial trucks will be needed to cart it to the nearest\nhazardous-waste dump, more than 100 miles away. That can cost\n$500 per cubic yard, and the Gladeville pit may contain 500\ncubic yards of soil by one estimate.\n   No wonder, then, that the broader, systemwide cleanup will\ntake time, money -- and more money. Already, Texas Eastern\nhas 29 people working on the project full-time, and 200\nmapping wells have been dug at contaminated sites along its\npipeline.

One such lawyer is Richard\nGrand of Tucson, Ariz., who has won 60 jury verdicts or\nsettlements of $1 million or more in 31 years of law\npractice. He hasn't lost a jury trial since 1962. The total\namount insurance companies have paid in his cases is about\n$200 million. According to Mr. Grand, corporate managers and\ninsurance companies can avoid the unnecessary mistakes that\nlead to these electrifying verdicts by handling litigation\nmore carefully.\n   -- Make a meaningful offer. The seven- and eight-figure\nverdicts typically involve a victim who suffered burns,\nparalysis, brain injury, death or a birth injury. Insurance\ncompanies have statistics on what these cases settle for. The\ndefense should write appropriate offers to settle these\nlawsuits -- even if there is no settlement demand (and even\nthough this goes against the common insurance-industry\npractice).\n   Preceding every million-dollar verdict Mr. Grand has\nobtained, he never has had an offer greater than 25% of the\namount the jury awarded. Most of the offers were zero\ndollars. For example, in a 1985 case a five-year-old girl was\nseverely burned when a camp stove spurted a stream of flaming\nfuel onto her. She sued Coleman Co., the camp-stove\nmanufacturer, and Coleman made no offer to settle. At trial\nMr. Grand proved that Coleman had known about the blowhole\nfuel defect for 20 years, and the jury awarded $7.86 million.\n   Coleman refused to make a settlement offer after the trial\nor during the appeal. After the state Supreme Court affirmed\nthe verdict, Coleman paid $8.54 million, including interest.\n   -- Look at the courtroom record of the plaintiff lawyer.\nInsurance companies pay based not only on the injury but also\non their fear of the plaintiff lawyer. According to Mr.\nGrand, insurance companies are \"grossly overpaying\" to settle\ncases where the plaintiff lawyer has never won a jury verdict\nof $1 million or more. Any lawyer can make a demand for seven\nfigures, but only a limited number of lawyers can\nconsistently persuade a jury to make such an award.\n   For example, the defense should determine if the opposing\nlawyer is a member of the Inner Circle of Advocates. Members\nof this organization have tried at least 50 cases to a\nverdict, including at least one with a jury award of $1\nmillion or more. The average age is 60, and these are\nseasoned plaintiff lawyers who consistently obtain large\nsettlements. Other \"trial\" associations and academies include\nlawyers who have never tried a case.\n   -- Start settlement negotiations early. It is true that\n90% of all lawsuits settle, but most high-stakes injury cases\nare settled on the courthouse steps before the trial. Late in\nthe proceedings, both parties will be hardened in their\npositions, and will have spent great sums on experts and\ndepositions. An insurance carrier will spend $500,000 to $2\nmillion to defend a big case. Late settlements are costly\nsettlements.\n   But early on, a plaintiff lawyer will have incurred few\ncosts and may agree to limit his contingency fee to settle\nthe case.\n   -- Retain a plaintiff lawyer as a defense consultant. In\nnegotiations, you should speak the language of the other\nside. Insurance companies, however, rarely heed this advice.\nA highly seasoned plaintiff lawyer retained by the defense\nwill be an effective negotiator in settlement talks.\n   Unfortunately, lawyers in America tend to line up along\nthe plaintiff or defense side and stay there, as has Mr.\nGrand, but it doesn't have to be this way. \"Most great\nlawyers really would like to do what barristers do in\nEngland, which is handle either side of a case,\" Mr. Grand\nsays.\n   Plaintiff lawyers routinely engage settlement consultants\nand negotiators. These are skilled specialists who advertise\ntheir availability for wrongful death and injury cases. The\ndefense should not go it alone either, especially when the\ncase may end with a seven-figure verdict. Just as investment\nbankers are brought in to assist with corporate mergers, the\ndefense should retain a plaintiff lawyer in a major injury\ncase.\n   -- Get the case into arbitration. It's not just for labor\ndisputes any more. The goal from the plaintiff's side is to\nget money into the victim's hands. The goal from the\ndefense's side is to end the case. Arbitration is a quick and\nless formal way to resolve an injury case.\n   Many lawyers are reluctant to try arbitration. Alternative\ndispute resolution isn't familiar, and lawyers are taught\nlittle about it in law school. But the ADR movement is\ngrowing, and a record 55,520 cases were filed in arbitration\nin 1989 to settle $2.4 billion in claims, according to the\nAmerican Arbitration Association. Many were insurance and\naccident claims.\n   In a case where a seven-figure verdict is possible,\nlitigation will almost certainly take years, and appeals will\nadd more time. Mr. Grand represented a policeman who was\nparalyzed from a gunshot wound in 1978. He won a $3.6 million\njury award that was upheld in 1982. The judgment was finally\npaid in 1984, but only after the defense spent hundreds of\nthousands of dollars vainly fighting the case, and filed for\nbankruptcy-law protection because of the verdict.\n   -- Is the defense lawyer in a feud? Most plaintiff lawyers\ndo not have a good relationship with defense counsel. Defense\nlawyers have emotions too, and can make their careers by\ndefeating a famous trial lawyer. A blood feud, however, can\nlead to a seven-figure verdict.\n   Corporate managers should interview their lawyers, just as\nthey would a new job applicant, and inquire at length how\nthey feel about the plaintiff lawyer.\n   ---\n   Mr. Bodine, an attorney, is the publisher of Lawyers\nAlert, a Boston-based national legal-news magazine.", "id": "\n900402-0091.", "title": "\n   Manager's Journal:\n   Your Best Defense?

Creditors would receive\nanywhere from a few pennies to perhaps 33 cents on the dollar\nfor the company's more than $1.2 billion in total public\ndebt. And Southmark still would end up as little more than a\nholding company for troubled San Jacinto Savings Association.\n   But the new plan would give creditors more cash up front,\nand also would grant them the option to halt Southmark's\ncurrent agreement with federal thrift regulators to pump an\nadditional $100 million in cash and notes into the ailing\nHouston thrift.\n   On the effective date of the new plan, Southmark would\ndistribute as much as $75 million to senior creditors and as\nmuch as $1 million to holders of allowed subordinated claims.\nIf sufficient cash isn't available, a new board elected by\ncreditors could decide to abrogate the agreement to invest\nmore in San Jacinto, Southmark said.\n   But Southmark advisers said they didn't expect that to\nhappen. Although some creditors had objected earlier to\nSouthmark's plan to reorganize around a Texas thrift -- and\nto pump in more money at that -- the alternative isn't\nattractive. If creditors renege, federal thrift regulators\nwould be free to assert claims against Southmark on behalf of\nSan Jacinto estimated at $1.4 billion.\n   \"I think {creditors} are coming to the same conclusion\nthat we had, that that's a very difficult, very expensive\npiece of litigation,\" said Paul Wickes, a senior bankruptcy\nattorney for Southmark. He added that the company is\n\"reasonably confident\" the cash will be there for creditors.\n   Representatives of the creditors' committee couldn't be\nreached immediately for comment on the plan. Southmark said\nthe committee agreed to withdraw its pending motion to end\nthe company's exclusive right to file a plan.\n   Terms of the new plan call for Southmark to issue $75\nmillion in new secured notes to senior creditors. Those\nnotes, bearing annual interest of 12%, would be repaid with\nproceeds from the sale of Southmark's real estate, brokerage,\nhealth care, oil and gas and insurance assets.\n   The company also would issue $100 million in new preferred\nstock, of which senior creditors would receive $88 million\nand subordinated creditors $12 million. Rather than being\nredeemed with the proceeds of asset sales, as contemplated in\nthe earlier plan, the preferred stock would pay special\ndividends from the proceeds to allow for more favorable tax\ntreatment, the company said.\n   Southmark also slashed the stake current equity holders\nwould be given in the reorganized company. Under the new\nplan, senior creditors would receive 64.7% of the company's\nnew common stock, while holders of senior subordinated debt\nwould receive 18.5%. Subordinated debt holders would receive\n11.3%; preferred shareholders 3%; and holders of common\nshares 2%.

The losses reflect junk\nbond-related loss provisions and write-downs of about $470\nmillion in the quarter. Moreover, the company said it had a\nloss of nearly $200 million in the first two months of 1990\nbecause of further junk bond trouble. As of Feb. 28, Columbia\nsaid it had a $121 million shareholder deficit, compared with\nequity of $77.6 million three months earlier.\n   The worse-than-expected results leave troubled Columbia\nteetering on the edge of federal receivership. The $9.25\nbillion-asset institution has been subject to federal\noperating restrictions for several months as junk bond losses\nhave eroded its equity to the point that it violated certain\nnew federal regulations for minimum capital levels. Because\nof federal regulations covering insolvent institutions, the\ncompany will now be barred from making any new loan or\ninvestment without prior regulatory approval, a condition\nthat regulators say makes it all but impossible to secure a\ncapital infusion from outside investors.\n   If Columbia fails, the government would become the\nnation's largest holder of junk bonds with a total portfolio,\nincluding junk bonds from other thrift failures, with a face\nvalue well in excess of $8 billion, and indicated losses of\nabout $2 billion. Regulators weren't available yesterday for\ncomment on Columbia.\n   Columbia officials declined to comment beyond a written\nstatement. Recently, the federal Office of Thrift Supervision\nhas shown little mercy in handling other capital-shy thrifts'\nbids to avoid federal receivership. Edward G. Harshfield,\nColumbia's president and chief executive officer, said in the\nstatement: \"Our regulators have been working with us in a\nvery constructive manner.\"\n   Federal regulators have already seized three of the thrift\nindustry's top five holders of junk bonds in recent months.\nThe junk bond losses reflect a provision of the thrift\nbailout bill last August that requires S&Ls to carry junk\nbonds on their books at market prices. The rule's impact on\nthe industry generally has been limited because relatively\nfew thrifts bought such bonds, but it has been devastating\nfor those that did.\n   Columbia's results also augur possibly\nlarger-than-anticipated losses at other junk bond-investing\nthrifts. In December, Columbia indicated it would take\nfourth-quarter write-downs or losses on its junk bond\nportfolio of at least $320 million, compared with the $470\nmillion in losses or write-downs that it ended up actually\nincurring. Because of write-downs and other factors, the\nvalue of junk bonds and certain preferred stock on Columbia's\nbooks sank to $3.38 billion as of Dec. 31 from $4.36 billion\nas of Sept. 30, a decline of 23%.\n   Columbia is pinning its hopes for avoiding federal\nreceivership on selling its junk bonds and concentrating on\nmaking mortgage loans and pursuing other traditional thrift\nactivities. But it is doubtful that regulators will approve\nthe plan because of the thrift's insolvency and bleaker\nprospects. Because of continuing upheaval in the junk bond\nmarket, for instance, Columbia said \"significant additional\nloss reserves and other asset write-downs\" were expected for\nthe month of March.\n   Columbia has proposed that it divest itself of all its\njunk bonds over five years as a way of meeting new\nregulations that bar thrifts from holding such bonds.\nYesterday, Columbia disclosed it had already sold $575\nmillion in junk bonds between last August and this past\nFebruary.\n   As an alternative, the company has also proposed a\none-time divestiture of the bonds as part of a \"structured\nfinancing.\" It said First Boston Corp. had begun discussions\nwith interested parties but that the plan carried some\ndrawbacks.\n   In the year, Columbia had a loss of $591.1 million, or\n$30.11 a share, compared with profit of $65 million, or $1.49\na share, in 1988. The 1989 results reflected write-downs and\nloss provisions totaling $870 million, most of which were\njunk bond-related. At year's end, Columbia said it had\nreserves for future junk bond losses of about $275 million,\nor enough to absorb a further 7.5% reduction in the value of\nits portfolio.\n   Moreover, Columbia's fourth-quarter report showed that it\nis having trouble in some of its hoped-for core businesses.\nIt reported a $43.7 million loss from real-estate operations\ncompared with a $22.3 million third-quarter loss and profit\nof $5 million in the year-earlier fourth quarter. Its\nfourth-quarter net interest income slid 47% to $31.7 million\nfrom $60.5 million, reflecting the higher cost of funds as\nwell as troubled assets.\n   Some analysts have questioned whether the company is\ncapable of successfully making the transition to being a\nconventional S&L, saying that it operates a relatively small\n29-office branch network and has traditionally gathered a\nlarge chunk of its deposits through Wall Street money\nbrokers.", "id": "\n900402-0001.", "title": "\n   Columbia S&L\n   Is Insolvent\n   Takeover Likely\n   ---\n   Thrift's Big Losses Blamed\n   On Sharp Deterioration\n   In Junk Bond Portfolio\n   ----\n   By Richard B.

That's because the recent\ncollapse of the junk-bond market makes it all but impossible\nthat junk underwriting fees will surge after the first\nquarter. Fees earned on new issues of these high-yield,\nhigh-risk bonds in the first quarter typically account for\njust 15% of the annual total; from 1984 through 1989,\njunk-bond fees jumped an average of 50% in the second\nquarter, Securities Data says.\n   These fees until recently were one of Wall Street's big\nprofit engines; the average junk deal earned a securities\nfirm $5 million. But the junk market's woe means Wall Street\ndoesn't have much to look forward to in the next few months.\n   \"Come the end of the next quarter and investment bankers\nare really going to feel the pinch,\" says Francine Wissak, an\nanalyst for Securities Data. Although some parts of the\nunderwriting business will rebound, says Edson Mitchell, a\nmanaging director for Merrill Lynch & Co., \"the loss of junk\nwill be very difficult to offset.\"\n   Underwriting fees are more important than ever on Wall\nStreet. That's because with the leveraging binge of the past\ndecade over, and merger activity down 60% from year-earlier\nlevels, investment bankers are scratching for ways to make\nmoney. And while quarterly numbers have to be taken with a\ngrain of salt, first-quarter rankings generally have been\nindicative of where securities firms stack up at the end of\nthe year.\n   There were a few bright spots. Fees from common-stock\nofferings surged 71% to $406 million. And underwriting\nprofits from initial public stock offerings, bolstered by a\nflurry of recent deals, rose 37% to $280 million. Publicly\ntraded funds continue to dominate IPOs, accounting for 60% of\ntotal volume. The current fad is closed-end funds that invest\nin a single foreign country; in past years, the hottest IPOs\nwere closed-end bond funds.\n   Still, even with the recent increased activity, fees from\nIPOs pale in comparison with the fees of only a few years\nago; in 1986's fourth quarter, for example, they stood at\n$541 million -- almost equal to underwriting fees from all\nsources during this quarter. So far this year, fees on IPOs\naccount for nearly half of all money earned from\nunderwritings in the U.S. market -- up from 36% a year\nearlier.\n   \"The types of financing that have driven profitability in\nthe past have declined notably,\" says Mark Seigel, a managing\ndirector at Morgan, Stanley & Co. \"The outlook for the near\nto medium term is mediocre at best.\"\n   Not surprisingly, the big losers were underwriters of junk\nbonds. Disclosed fees from junk-bond underwritings plummeted\nto a paltry $10.8 million from a total of just three new\nissues. A year earlier, 26 new junk issues earned Wall Street\n$151 million in fees.\n   Of course, February's collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert\nInc., which virtually created and then dominated the junk\nmarket for much of the 1980s, added to the woes. But few\nother firms picked up the slack: In the first quarter, the\nonly new junk offerings were underwritten by Goldman, Sachs &\nCo. (Kroger Co.), Merrill Lynch (Sullivan Graphics) and Dain\nBosworth Inc. (TCF Banking & Savings).\n   Goldman was the leader in fee income, with $99 million. Of\nthe 32 issues it underwrote, Goldman's junk offering of\nKroger ($6.3 million in fees) and its IPOs for Readers Digest\nAssociation ($21 million), Teppco Partners L.P. ($17.6\nmillion) and Santa Fe Energy Resources ($9.8 million)\ncatapulted the firm to the top of the fee heap. Still, it's\nbeen more than four years since the top underwriter based on\ndisclosed fees earned less than $100 million, Securities Data\nsaid.\n   Merrill Lynch underwrote more issues than Goldman, but\nstill ended up with less in fee income, earning $86.8\nmillion. Salomon Brothers Inc. jumped to No. 3 from the\neighth spot a year earlier, earning $63.2 million.\n   But First Boston Corp. slumped badly. The firm, beset by\njunk-related troubles and holding some irksome temporary\n\"bridge\" loans, fell to seventh place from No. 3, earning\njust $35.4 million on 17 issues. A year earlier, First Boston\nunderwrote 29 issues, earning $77.7 million in fees.\n   The last few weeks of the quarter salvaged what could have\nbeen a disastrous period. More than $19 billion of corporate\nnew issues were sold in the last two weeks of March alone,\nhiking 1990 financing volume to $77.7 billion from $73.3\nbillion in the year-earlier period. Fees from these new\nissues in the past two weeks totaled $179.3 million -- or\n30.3% of the quarter's total fees.\n   Mortgage and asset-backed securities continued to\nflourish, but they didn't amount to much in disclosed fees\nfor Wall Street. Such fees totaled just $39.9 million for\nsecurities firms. A year earlier, disclosed fees were $65.3\nmillion.\n   Issues of other fixed-income debt were more scarce.\nConcerned about the specter of higher interest rates,\ncorporate treasurers in the quarter issued only $25.6 billion\nworth of debt securities, including junk bonds, 33% less than\na year earlier and the lowest level since the fall of 1985.\nFees from corporate debt issues slumped to $103.4 million,\nfrom $238.6 million in 1989's first period.\n   Some industry executives and analysts expect a pattern of\nincreased common-stock offerings and slower issuance of new\ndebt to continue over the next several years. After the debt\nbinge of the '80s, says Alison Deans of Kidder, Peabody &\nCo., many companies will be reducing leverage by raising more\nequity capital and borrowing less.\n   Meanwhile, the recent heavy layoffs on Wall Street will\nhelp mitigate the impact of currently stunted underwriting\ngrowth, some analysts say. Since the October 1987\nstock-market crash, nearly 45,000 securities-industry\nemployees have been laid off nationwide.

Sinclair, the\nnewly appointed president of Pepsi's international business,\nsaid.\n   Pepsi's optimism, however, was met with some skepticism by\nindustry observers. With Coke's more than 2-to-1 market-share\nlead in the international arena, analysts said it's unlikely\nthat Pepsi can significantly close the gap abroad overnight.\n   Moreover, although Pepsi said its $1 billion budget is\n\"substantially\" more than it has invested in the past,\nindustry observers said Pepsi will probably have to spend\nsubstantially more if it ever hopes to catch Coke.\n   In 1989, Coke had about $4.8 billion in revenue from\noverseas, while Pepsi had $1 billion. Coke estimates its\ninternational market share is 47% while Pepsi's is less than\nhalf that.\n   \"I think they're going to have a tough time catching Coke\nreally soon,\" said Gary Hemphill, editor of Beverage Industry\nmagazine. \"At the same time, there's so much growth\ninternationally that there's room for both of them out\nthere.\"\n   While U.S. soft-drink volume has slowed to about a 3%\nannual growth rate recently from 4% to 5% in the 1980s, the\ninternational market is expected to grow in 8% to 10% leaps\nannually for years to come.\n   \"This meeting acknowledges where the soft-drink industry\nis really headed: offshore,\" said Jesse Meyers, publisher of\nBeverage Digest, a trade newsletter. \"While Coke has a\nsubstantial lead, there are still unplayed cards in Southeast\nAsia, Russia, and now Eastern Europe.\"\n   A Coca-Cola spokesman dismissed Pepsi's plans to match\nCoke overseas as \"dreaming.\"\n   The Pepsi convention seemed like an orchestrated attempt\nto rally overseas bottlers and to convince them once and for\nall that Pepsi is committed to the soda business abroad.\nUnder the crush of Coke's global strength, some Pepsi\ninternational bottlers have felt neglected, particularly as\nPepsiCo has plunged hundreds of millions of dollars into\nbuilding its snack and restaurant businesses abroad.\n   The company even flew out D. Wayne Calloway, PepsiCo's\nchairman and chief executive officer, to address the troops.\nSaying the bottlers' efforts were critical to PepsiCo's\nsuccess, Mr. Calloway promised to send each a share of the\ncompany's stock to mark their relationship.\n   Pepsi also gave its international partners some new signs\nof hope. In May, Pepsi expects to open its first plants in\nIndia, a giant market of 800 million consumers where Coke was\nrecently denied approval to sell soft drinks. And in the\nSoviet Union, where Pepsi currently outsells Coke, Mr.\nSinclair said he expects to soon announce \"an agreement that\nwill be the largest consumer products venture ever\" in that\ncountry.\n   Mr. Sinclair conceded that Pepsi still needs to clean its\ninternational house. Taste quality of its soft drinks varies\nfrom country to country, packaging graphics are inconsistent\nworld-wide, and production inefficiencies have resulted in\npartially filled bottles ending up on store shelves abroad.\n   To help put an end to such basic problems, Pepsi will be\nissuing a \"Look Book,\" a manual on how to acquire and use the\nbest graphics available. The company plans to centralize\nadvertising-copy approval under its top creative executive in\nthe U.S., and it is launching the Pepsi Cola International\nManagement Institute to teach overseas managers the best\ntechniques in sales, finance and plant operations, among\nother things.\n   All of this comes on the heels of a corporate\nreorganization late last year in which Pepsi reversed its\ncentralized approach, creating six geographic operations\nworld-wide with broad local autonomy.", "id": "\n900402-0140.", "title": "\n   Marketing & Media:\n   PepsiCo Plans Extensive Ad Campaign\n   To Contest Coke's Overseas Dominance\n   ---\n   By Michael J.

Partly\nbecause of this, the record companies have agreed to come up\nwith a new voluntary industrywide labeling standard.\n   The debate over labeling raises serious questions about\nthe role of government and about artistic freedom.\n   Michele Davis, director of the Republican Governors\nAssociation, says, \"For the decade of the 1990s, the most\nbitter, emotional debates -- the screaming, the crying, the\nreal tough questions -- are going to be in the state\ncapitols.\"\n   Tanya Blackwood, spokeswoman for the Recording Industry\nAssociation of America, says, \"All of this stuff going on in\nthe state legislatures is one of the most serious issues the\nrecord industry has faced. It's harder to fight because we're\ndealing with all of these legislatures instead of just going\nup to Capitol Hill and conducting one fight.\"\n   Many of the state bills were prompted by conservative\ngroups -- some of them part of the Christian Right -- that\nsprang up to battle school curricula, sex education, abortion\nrights and child care. The groups include the Rev. Donald\nWildmon's American Family Association.\n   \"This is a political force in its own right,\" says Michael\nGeer, president of the Pennsylvania Family Institute. Thomas\nJipping, director of the Washington-based Free Congress\nCenter for Law and Democracy, says, \"It's part of the same\npro-family movement that's trying to protect traditional\nvalues.\"\n   The issue cuts across political party lines. The major\nsponsors of record-label legislation here in Maryland and in\nPennsylvania were Democrats.\n   \"I'm not Jerry Falwell,\" says state Rep. Ronald Gamble,\nwhose bill to require record labeling prevailed in the\nPennsylvania House 149-51. \"We're regular guys who don't\nthink kids should be listening to this junk. We're spending\nmillions fighting teen violence and suicide and then across\nthe street there's the recording industry glorifying and\npromoting the very things we're fighting.\"\n   The labeling movement got its start when Tipper Gore, wife\nof U.S. Sen. Albert Gore, and Susan Baker, wife of Secretary\nof State James Baker, expressed alarm at songs dealing with\nsex and violence.\n   Four years ago, their group, Parents' Music Resource\nCenter, and the National PTA agreed with the Recording\nIndustry Association of America on a voluntary labeling\nsystem. It included a warning label (\"Explicit lyrics,\nparental advisory\") or the printing of the lyrics on the\nrecord jacket.\n   Today, Parents' Music Resource Center opposes the bills in\nstate legislatures making record labeling a legal\nrequirement.\n   \"The record producers can show responsibility themselves\nby creating a useful consumer tool,\" says Mrs. Gore.

But one of the bedrock ideas of our society\nis that we allow all kinds of ideas, even offensive ones.\"\n   When Maryland's House Judiciary Committee recently\nconsidered labeling legislation, the hearing attracted Jim\nRogers, director of Mission America who says \"we have to have\nmainstream ideas controlling the country,\" and Kenneth\nStevens, a retired federal employee who says \"the prudish\nsuper-moralists persist in trying to use government to tell\nthe rest of us what we can read or view.\" The bill died in\ncommittee.\n   In some states, music industry officials worry that\nlegislative moves could disrupt the music distribution\nsystem.

From a high in\nthe Dow Jones Industrial Average of 2810.15 on Jan. 2, prices\nslipped 9.5% in January. They regained some of that lost\nground in February and reclaimed even more in March to end\n3.7% lower than the record.\n   To investors already nervous about high interest rates,\nrising inflation and an uncertain economic outlook, however,\nthe increasingly sluggish trading activity is one more reason\nto be wary of the stock market.\n   But some analysts argue that with few exceptions, volume\nisn't a very good indicator of where prices are headed. In a\n1988 study that tracked volume and price moves as far back as\n1915, Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, a\nstock market strategy firm, found that \"volume is not a lead\nindicator of any sort of reliability.\"\n   Mr. Birinyi says his study showed that there were links\nbetween prices and increases and decreases in trading volume,\nbut that the links were coincident, not predictive. For\ninstance, in bull markets he found that either volume peaked\nlong before prices or else volume fluctuated widely during\nthe course of a rally. In short, he says, \"any relationships\nbetween price and activity are random.\"\n   Bear markets show similar patterns. In the 1977 market\ndecline, for example, volume fluctuated while prices fell.\n\"We doubt that investors could have relied on current volume\ntrend as a way to avoid losses in this period,\" Mr. Birinyi\nsays.\n   The only exception -- and it is a dangerous one -- is if\nvolume expands rapidly in a falling market. \"If you do have a\npickup in volume in a declining market, then you have to\nworry,\" he says. \"The most dangerous patterns seem to be\ntrading increases of nearly 100% during a bear pattern. In\nthese times, price declines are especially severe.\"\n   But predicting major moves based on volume is futile, Mr.\nBirinyi asserts. In the three months before the 1982 bull\nmarket began, for instance, the volume of trading in the Dow\nJones Industrial Average stocks declined. \"The relationship\nbetween volume and prices or rallies just doesn't exist,\" he\nsays.\n   Nonsense, counters Mark Leibovit, author of the Volume\nReversal Survey, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter that relies\nheavily on trading volume to predict what's ahead for stock\nprices.\n   \"There's an old adage that says volume precedes price,\"\nsays Mr. Leibovit. \"I've been doing this for 20 years and\nI've never found a better indicator.\"\n   He contends that volume signals overall demand for stocks.\nWhen a big move up is beginning, he says, high volume cleans\nout many of the investors or traders who wanted to sell,\nleaving the remaining demand to drive prices higher. \"Like a\nballoon, prices begin rising because there's no resistance,\"\nhe says.\n   Similarly, at the beginning of a big down move a big surge\nin trading volume satisfies the waning demand for stocks and\nfurther selling drives prices lower. \"That's when prices go\ndown like a lead balloon,\" he says.\n   March's price gains have been welcome, says Mr. Leibovit,\nbut the sluggish volume in recent days likely means the rally\nis about exhausted. \"I'm not ready to throw in the towel\nyet,\" he says, \"but my basic view is that if we're not at the\ntop already, we're only about 50 points away.\"\n   After that, he says, the longer-term trend down will\nreassert itself. He saw that trend beginning in January when,\nfor three consecutive weeks, prices fell on expanding volume.\n\"That, to me, was pretty negative,\" he says. He expects\nprices to eventually work their way back down to the January\nclosing low of 2543.24 or even lower. \"I paint myself more in\nthe bear camp long term,\" he said.\n   Kenneth Spence, a technical analyst at Salomon Brothers,\nalso finds trading volume useful in assessing stock market\nperformance, although he cautions that investors shouldn't\nrely too heavily on volume alone. Breadth, or the number of\nstocks rising compared to the number falling, is also\nimportant, he says.\n   \"What technicians get concerned about is rising prices on\nnarrow breadth and light volume,\" says Mr. Spence. \"That's\nindicative of selective strength, not broadbased strength.\nThe broader the base, the more sustainable the health of the\nmarket.\"\n   Narrow breadth and light volume is confronting investors\nright now in the stock market, he says. And while he doesn't\npredict an imminent decline in stock prices, Mr. Spence urges\ncaution. \"The volume and breadth don't tell us anything about\nhow far prices could fall, but they are flashing a big yellow\nlight.\"", "id": "\n900402-0047.", "title": "\n   Confusing Clue:\n   Volume Ebbs\n   On Big Board\n   ----\n   By Douglas R.

The two men had originally met as adversaries when\nMr. Rotenstreich, as an investment banker at Salomon Brothers\nInc., had represented Liberty National in its pursuit of\nGlobe. Say Mr. Richey: \"I never thought they paid enough for\nGlobe, and he was the primary reason.\"\n   Mr. Rotenstreich, though a Birmingham native, prefers Wall\nStreet to the South. From an antique-decorated office\noverlooking Central Park, he manages a $3 billion investment\nportfolio with just eight people.\n   Together, analysts say, there is not a better top\nmanagement duo in the insurance industry. Torchmark's return\non equity has been above 20% for the past four years, about\ndouble its peer-group average. Primarily through Mr.\nRotenstreich's efforts -- including the repurchase of about\n23 million Torchmark shares -- the company's stock price more\nthan doubled between 1987 and 1989. Like most insurers,\nhowever, Torchmark's profit growth has been squeezed recently\nby smaller growth in premiums.\n   To remedy the problem, Messrs. Richey and Rotenstreich\ndecided in November 1988 to launch a $318 million hostile\ntender offer for Kansas City Life Insurance Co. to build on\nTorchmark's insurance franchise. \"One of our major units is\nbased in Kansas, so we thought it was a nice geographic fit,\"\nsays Mr. Richey. \"There was also an opportunity to realize\nsome {cost} efficiencies in their operation.\"\n   But Kansas City Life, which is controlled by the Bixby\nfamily, rejected the offer less than a month later. Mr.\nRotenstreich says Torchmark simply took the cash and\nrepurchased an additional 1.6 million of its shares at an\naverage price of $34.35. \"It obviously didn't hurt us any,\"\nhe says. \"Our per-share profits were up again over 20% last\nyear.\"\n   The team now has its sights set on much bigger game. The\npair believes it can squeeze the same cost-efficiencies out\nof American General that it did with Torchmark. Says Mr.\nRichey: \"You can see that a lot can be done with an even\nlarger organization in our business.\"\n   \"With consolidation becoming a growing trend in this\nindustry,\" Mr. Richey says, \"we're talking about creating a\nlarge, public company with a substantial {market} penetration\nand cash-flow position.\"", "id": "\n900402-0136.", "title": "\n   Who's News:\n   Torchmark Duo Shows Opposites Attract\n   ---\n   Conservative Chairman,\n   Aggressive President Gel\n   ----\n   By Rick Christie\n   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal"}, "doc\n900402-0115.": {"content": "\n   Angio-Medical, which develops and markets pharmaceutical\nand cosmetic products, has reported losses recently.

Similarly, analysts plan to take with a grain\nof salt Friday's important employment report for March,\nbecause of some odd factors that help boost job totals. The\nweek's other offerings include March auto sales and February\ndata on consumer credit, the index of leading indicators and\nconstruction spending.\n   An improved purchasers' index \"is more auto-related than\nanything else,\" Donald Fine, chief economist at Chase\nManhattan Bank, New York, said. \"The auto industry virtually\nshut down in January. In combination, February and March\nbrought back production levels to near where they were in the\nfourth quarter.\"\n   Michael P. Niemira, economist at Mitsubishi Bank, New\nYork, said the rebound in Chicago purchasers' data reaffirm\nhis view that a \"mini-inventory correction\" that began at the\nend of last year may have run its course. Last Friday, the\nPurchasing Management Association of Chicago reported its\nindex of area business activity rose to 55.1% on an\nunadjusted basis in March from 51% in February.\n   The broader report, which is to be released today by the\nNational Association of Purchasing Management, is expected to\ninch ahead to 48.5% from 48.3% in February, according to a\nsurvey by MMS International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. The\npurchasing data have become increasingly important to\neconomists and traders who are eager for data on economic\nactivity and the possible direction of interest rates. In\naddition, the report usually provides the month's -- and the\nnew quarter's -- first reading on the nation's manufacturing\npulse.\n   A reading above 50% indicates an expanding economy, while\na reading below 50% suggests contraction. The National\nAssociation of Purchasing Management index has been under 50%\nsince May 1989.\n   The MMS survey on the national purchasers' index,\nconducted after Chicago's data were reported, showed a\nstrengthening of 1.2 percentage points from a week earlier,\nwhen the median expectation was for a 47.3% reading on the\nnational gauge.\n   Mitsubishi Bank's Mr. Niemira said he too raised his\nestimate of the association's index to 49% from 48.5% after\nthe Chicago report came out. Still, he said: \"The Chicago\nreport should be kept in perspective. It's right where it was\nin the fourth quarter. Things aren't exactly booming.\"\n   Samuel Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in\nChicago, agreed that his city is \"still enjoying a rebound\"\nthat probably plumped the local purchasers' report. But he\nalso noted that numbers without context can be misleading.\nPointing to the recent hearty employment data, he said:\n\"People are taking the employment numbers at face value and\nextrapolating them to what the economy is doing. The truth\nis, I'm not sure you can hypothesize.\"\n   The unemployment rate for March is expected to remain\nunchanged at 5.3%. And new job growth, while a bit less\nsignificant than that in January and February, is likely to\nbe fairly strong, with 175,000 nonfarm jobs created,\naccording to MMS. But economists noted that early-year data\nwere influenced by an unusual increase in construction jobs\nowing to mild weather. Recent jobs data have been affected by\nthe ebb and flow of auto jobs. In addition, this week's\nreport is likely to reflect the first major addition of\nspecially hired census workers.\n   All in all, Mr. Kahan said, \"It looks to me like the\neconomy isn't gathering steam, but that we are continuing to\nflounder at this level.\"\n   While the unemployment rate is expected to be unchanged,\nestimates on new-job creation range broadly, from 100,000 to\n303,000, according to MMS. In February, 275,000 new jobs were\ngenerated. In addition to job totals, economists are keeping\na close eye on wage levels and their possible effect on\ninflation. Hourly earnings in March are believed to have\nincreased about 0.2%.\n   February construction outlays, in a report to be released\ntoday, are expected to have risen about 0.5%, following a\n1.8% increase in January, when the weather was unseasonably\nwarm.\n   Economists don't expect much forecasting help from\ntomorrow's leading indicators index. The February index is\nbelieved to have dropped a sharp 0.7%, largely because of a\nsteep drop in the number of housing permits issued. Housing\npermits skyrocketed in the previous month, as developers\nrushed to escape new handicapped-access rules.\n   Consumer credit, another indicator tied firmly to auto\nsales, is expected to have fallen in February. The credit\ntally, to be issued Friday, is expected to have slowed to\nabout $3 billion, following January's $3.5 billion gain.\n   ---\n                 Closely Watched Reports\n                                                                                                       \n\n      Statistics Released in the Week Ended March 30\n                                                                                                       \n\n                                                CHANGE\n                                               (from prior\n                                 TOTAL          period)\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Money supply\n                                                                                                       \n\n     M1 -- Week ended\n     March 19 (in billions)      $802.2         Unch.\n                                                                                                       \n\n     M2 -- Week ended\n     March 19 (in billions)    $3,271.0         +$1.5\n                                                                                                       \n\n     M3 -- Week ended\n     March 19 (in billions)    $4,070.4         -$0.6\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Real GNP\n   Fourth quarter, final\n   annual rate (in trillions)    $4.174         +1.1%\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Manufacturer's orders\n   February (in billions)       $231.64         +1.8%\n                                                                                                       \n\n   New homes sold\n   February, annual rate        607,000         3.1%\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Manufacturer's shipments\n   February (in billions)       $234.17         +3.3%\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Personal income\n   February, annual rate\n   (in trillions)                $4.636         +0.9%\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Personal consumption\n   February, annual rate\n   (in trillions)                $3.632         +0.4%\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Savings rate\n   February, change in\n   percentage points               5.7%         +0.4\n                                                                                                       \n\n   New jobless claims\n   Week ended March 17          350,000         -2.8%\n                                                                                                       \n\n            Statistics to Be Released This Week\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Purchasing agents' index (Mon.)\n   March\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Construction spending (Mon.)\n\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Leading indicators index (Tues.)\n   February\n                                                                                                       \n\n   New car sales (Wed.)\n   March\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Money supply (Thurs.)\n                                                                                                       \n\n   New jobless claims (Thurs.)\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Consumer credit (Fri.)\n   February\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Employment, payroll (Fri.)\n   March\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Unemployment rate (Fri.)\n   March", "id": "\n900402-0026.", "title": "\n   Economy -- Tracking the Economy:\n   Vigorous Data May Reflect Detour's End\n   And Not a New Trend, Economists Warn\n   ----\n   By Pamela Sebastian\n   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal"}, "doc\n900402-0124.": {"content": "\n   Problem is, Toyota didn't win the war.

Eventually Queen Elizabeth trips because her train is\nencrusted with hundreds of pearls, and John Fustian, in a\nsingle bound from the foot of the stairs, catches her in his\narms. As a reward, she knights him on the spot; not only\nthat, she tears five pearls from her train to be embedded in\nthe handle of the sword she presents to him. Ms. Smith, an\nexceptionally talented performer, also can be an\nexasperatingly flamboyant one. Here, however, her impeccable\ncomic timing, her varied vocal deliveries -- from mock\nsurprise, to deep-throated declarations, to nasal ennui --\nand her sweeping hand gestures are perfect for the character.\n   At the end of one of Lettice's more extravagant lectures\non Fustian House, a singularly plain woman steps forth to\nquestion the veracity of the narrative. This turns out to be\nLotte Schoen, a supervisor with the Preservation Trust who\nhas had numerous complaints about the excesses of Lettice's\nperformance. Practical, literal-minded Lotte is the ideal\nfoil for Lettice, especially as performed by Margaret Tyzack.\nOne of Britain's most accomplished actresses, with a range\nthat extends from inspired classical interpretations with the\nNational Theater and the Royal Shakespeare Company to\nmemorable film and television roles, Ms. Tyzack proves her\nmettle as a comic performer here.\n   Scene two of \"Lettice and Lovage\" takes place in Lotte's\nLondon office, where Lettice has been called to show cause\nwhy she should not be fired. Rather than apologizing for her\nactions, Lettice defends them. Appearing in an Elizabethan\nlong cloak and wearing a hat with a flowing plume, she says\nthat she has enormous respect for history. Her mother was a\nShakespearean actress who could not find work in England and\nso led a troupe of women in France, performing Shakespeare in\nFrench, but always the history plays. Thus, Lettice has a\ndouble heritage: history and the theater. When history turns\nout not to be dramatic, however, she feels it her duty to\nenliven and enhance it.\n   Lotte remains unconvinced and Lettice is fired, whereupon\nMs. Smith magisterially rises from her chair and proceeds to\nreenact the role of Mary Queen of Scots facing her\nexecutioner. Journalistic ethics prohibit revealing the exact\nnature of her reenactment; suffice it to say that Ms. Smith's\nfinal moments afford an unforgettable climax to the act.\n   \"Lettice and Lovage\" is by playwright Peter Shaffer, whose\nrecent plays, \"Equus\" and \"Amadeus,\" have been serious, but\nwho returns here to the farce form he employed earlier in his\ncareer. As with his serious work, the theme of \"Lettice and\nLovage\" is the contrast between the artistic, imaginative\nfree spirit, personified by Lettice, and the rational,\nearthbound Type. A personality exemplified by Lotte. As\nalways, the latter finds the liberating qualities of the\nformer irresistible.\n   Having fired Lettice at the end of act one, the\nguilt-ridden Lotte comes to visit her in act two at her\napartment. Lettice induces Lotte to try her Renaissance\nliqueur -- a concoction that includes, along with generous\nportions of alcohol, an aromatic herb called lovage. Not\nsurprisingly, Lotte loosens up, and under the influence of\nLettice and her lovage reveals her own long-dead aspirations.\nShe had once wanted to be an architect, one whose mission\nincluded subversive acts against the monstrosities of modern\narchitecture she saw rising around her. When given a chance,\nhowever, to sabotage one of these temples of mediocrity, she\nhad a failure of nerve and ended up in her bureaucratic job\nat the Preservation Trust.\n   Mr. Shaffer, having maintained a firm grip on the comic\nspirit through act one and most of act two, lets it slip away\nfrom him rather seriously in act three, when the actions of\nthe two women become silly. He develops an involved,\nfar-fetched plot that has his heroines engaged in mock\nhistorical executions, one of which lands Lettice in court\nwith Lotte scheduled to serve as a witness against her.\n   Fortunately, the comic momentum of the production carries\nus through this lapse and we come away remembering the\nexhilaration of the earlier scenes and the artistry of Ms.\nSmith and Ms. Tyzack. Added to this are excellent supporting\nperformances by Bette Henritze as a mousy secretary and\nPaxton Whitehead as a pompous, befuddled lawyer, all adroitly\ndirected by Michael Blakemore.", "id": "\n900402-0146.", "title": "\n   LEISURE & ARTS:\n   Theater: Maggie Smith's Tour de Force"}, "doc\n900402-0004.": {"content": "\n   AHA officials met throughout the weekend to discuss their\noptions. Industry executives believe the group, while doing\naway with the seal itself, will refocus on other parts of the\nseal program, known as HeartGuide. Among the alternatives\nthey are considering are education efforts and working with\nthe FDA either on a different labeling program or to refine\nthe regulatory agency's own proposed food labeling\nregulations.\n   The seal-of-approval concept has been troubled from the\nstart. The AHA developed the program to identify foods it\ndeemed low in cholesterol, sodium and fats. Brands that\npassed muster -- and paid a fee -- could display the AHA\nHeartGuide logo on their labels and in advertising. The AHA\nhad grand visions of making the seal the equivalent of the\nGood Housekeeping seal, and encouraged products that bore it\nto trumpet the fact in ads. When the seal was introduced in\nearly February, several brands, including Mazola and Promise\nmargarines and Pam non-stick spray, were planning major\nmarketing campaigns around it.\n   But the program immediately raised the ire of the FDA,\nwhich promptly threatened regulatory action. In a warning\nletter sent in February, James S. Benson, acting commissioner\nof the FDA, told the AHA that its program would \"increase\nconsumer confusion and hamper any comprehensive solution to\nthe food-labeling problem.\" For example, the FDA was\nconcerned that the HeartGuide seal on margarine and oils\nwould lead consumers to believe that these were health foods.\nFriday, the FDA repeated its objections to third-party\nendorsements in another letter to the AHA.\n   The FDA's complaints prompted most of the 103 brands in\nthe initial launch of HeartGuide to back out before the\nprogram even started; among the defectors were Mazola, Pam,\nPromise and C&W Frozen Foods. But several dozen remained,\nwith some going through the expense of redesigning their\npackaging to show off the seal. They will now have to remove\nthe seal, if they haven't already.\n   The HeartGuide seal's demise comes as the FDA is\nconsidering its own health-claim labeling regulations,\nperhaps with input from the AHA. The FDA earlier this year\nproposed tough new labeling restrictions that would crack\ndown on many claims, and probably would discourage many of\nthe labeling claims made today. But consumer activist groups\nhave criticized the FDA for dragging its feet on health\nclaims.\n   \"I'm concerned that the FDA won't go far enough or act\nquickly enough,\" says Bonnie Liebman, director of nutrition\nfor the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer\nactivist group. \"The demise of this program means we need to\nput more pressure on the FDA. It provides one more reason to\npush for legislation that would force the FDA to overhaul\nfood labels.\" Two bills pending on Capitol Hill would require\nthe FDA to define terms like \"light\" and \"low fat.\"\n   The FDA declined to comment. It may have been concerned\nbecause other health groups were considering their own stamps\nof approval for foods, which could have led to consumer\nconfusion.\n   Still, says Ms. Liebman, the demise of the HeartGuide seal\n\"is a shame for consumers who want simple thumbs up or thumbs\ndown advice on whether a food is good for their heart. This\nkind of labeling is something the FDA should have been doing\na long time ago.\"\n   ---\n   Campbell Soup Accounts\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Campbell Soup announced a long-expected consolidation of\nits ad agency lineup, cutting out three agencies while\nspreading the bulk of its $150 million account more equally\namong four others.\n   In the reorganization, Campbell cuts out DDB Needham, Hal\nRiney & Partners and Saatchi & Saatchi/London, each of which\nhad relatively small pieces of Campbell business.

James\nFlorio of New Jersey, a state up to its eyeballs in garbage.\n   The Littleton program also will pick up every shape and\ncolor of glass, plus a large number of paper products,\nincluding corrugated cardboard, grocery bags, writing and\ncomputer paper, even the kids' colored notebook paper, along\nwith newspapers. Plastic, too, is on the menu, specifically\nplastic grocery bags, soda bottles and milk jugs.\n   Then there are, for the lack of a better description,\nspecialty items, such as brass faucets, stainless steel sinks\nand counter tops, copper wire and tubing, plus lawnmower\ncasings.\n   \"I'm cleaning out my house,\" says Ken-Caryl resident Cathy\nJohnson, who pushed for the comprehensive recycling program\nalong with several other residents. \"I'm throwing out huge\nballs of aluminum foil and even my old lawn chairs,\" she\nsays.\n   The Ken-Caryl program has other advantages over most of\nthe U.S.'s 5,000 or so existing curbside recycling programs.\nOne is that homeowners won't be asked to sort their\nrecyclables -- a task that has been a real turn-off for some\n-- but rather will only have to put everything into a giant,\n14-gallon bin. (The big items can be put out separately.)\nPick-up will be once a week by Laidlaw Waste Systems Inc., a\nunit of Laidlaw Transportation Ltd. of Canada., which will\nhave a compactor truck follow its regular garbage truck\nthrough the 2,700-home community.\n   Another advantage is cost. According to Tri-R Systems\nCorp., a Denver-based recycling firm that will sort and sell\nthe recycled 35 items picked up by Laidlaw, the typical\ncurbside recycling program currently costs about $2.50 per\nhousehold per month. Of that amount, about 15 cents flows\nback to the community from the revenue generated by the sale\nof the recycled goods.\n   By contrast, the Ken-Caryl program will generate about 25\ncents to 40 cents per household back to the community,\naccording to Tri-R chairman and president David Powelson.\nMoreover, the additional revenue will come from more reliable\nmetals markets, offsetting the wide price swings for\nnewspaper and glass that have recently hurt many municipal\nprograms.\n   Mr. Powelson says that among the other items scheduled to\nbe added to the Ken-Caryl program are tin cans, junk mail and\npolystyrene. The latter has been banned by some\nmunicipalities, but Mr. Powelson says that since the Food and\nDrug Administration recently agreed to let recycled\npolystyrene be used for making egg cartons, Tri-R will soon\nhave a resale market for that plastic material.\n   Still, there are some things most homeowners commonly\nthrow away that won't be picked up. Batteries and motor oil\nare two of them. Mr. Powelson explains that because both are\nlisted as hazardous substances, picking them up \"would be\nlike picking up asbestos.\"\n   Another common throwaway, the telephone book, also isn't\non the list, even though telephone books have been singled\nout by environmentalists for needlessly filling up scarce\nlandfill space.

Even the strenuous\nopposition of President Corazon Aquino seems unlikely to\nderail his attempt to succeed her.\n   The comeback of this crony king, a feared hatchet man who\nhas been charged by the Aquino government with stealing\ncontrol of more than $1.5 billion of corporate assets, casts\na dark cloud over democracy in the Philippines. In three\ndecades of public service, Mr. Cojuangco has never shown any\ndesire to share power with anyone but Mr. Marcos. And he's\ndead.\n   \"There's no way Danding could lead within a pluralistic\nsystem that held him accountable,\" says Stephen Bosworth,\nU.S. ambassador to the Philippines from 1984 to 1987. \"He\noperates best in the netherworld.\"\n   Two currents are pushing a back-slide in the Philippines:\nMr. Cojuangco's own enduring power and the chronic weakness\nof his first cousin and political enemy, Cory Aquino. With\nshortages of rice, water, electricity, transportation and\nother necessities growing, a drumbeat is building here for an\nautocrat to take charge again. Mr. Cojuangco, who adroitly\nbuilt his own political base to weather Mr. Marcos's\ndownfall, is emerging as the leading candidate for the job.\nEven if Mrs. Aquino survives the military discontent that has\nbred six coup attempts in her four years of power, she or a\nchosen successor will have difficulty beating a Cojuangco-led\nticket in elections set for 1992.\n   \"Danding is more ruthless, more cunning than the rest\" of\nMrs. Aquino's opponents, says Bren Guiao, governor of\nPampanga province and a close Aquino ally. \"He has better\npolitical acumen, but more importantly, he has more\nresources.\"\n   Other likely presidential candidates include Vice\nPresident Salvador Laurel and Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile. Both\nare better known abroad than Danding, but neither enjoys his\nstature in the Philippines.\n   Though well aware that Washington loathes him, Danding and\nhis supporters insist that as president he would make every\nattempt to maintain strong relations with the U.S. Danding\nhimself hasn't taken a public position on the U.S. military\nbases in the Philippines -- a perennial source of controversy\nbetween the two countries. But some of his supporters sound\nas if they are bending over backwards to accommodate the\nAmericans. \"If we have our way, they can have the bases\nwithout any rent,\" says Eliodoro Castro, one of Danding's\noldest allies in his home province of Tarlac.\n   The rehabilitation of \"Boss\" Danding could only happen in\none of the most peculiar political cultures in the world.\nWhile U.S. officials exult over the restoration of democracy\nunder Mrs. Aquino, Philippine politics remains much the same\ntoday as during Mr. Marcos's 20-year rule and prior regimes.\nIt is a system rooted in the ancient ways of clan warfare,\nmolded by four centuries of Spanish feudalism, and coated\nwith a thin gloss of U.S.-style democracy.\n   Issues and ideology mean little. Political parties and\nplatforms are window dressing for patronage and personality\ncults. What counts is who can deliver the favors, who can buy\nthe votes, who can arm the goons.\n   In these black arts, the 54-year-old Mr. Cojuangco is\nwithout equal, say friends and foes alike. Danding, who was\ninterviewed for this story but wouldn't allow direct\nquotations, says his reputation is exaggerated.\n   During the Marcos era, he amassed a security force of\nthousands, drilled by Israeli mercenaries. But as one friend\nput it, Danding preferred to \"kill with kindness\"; he\npersonally handed out Christmas bonuses to employees of the\nmany companies he controlled, pretending the money came from\nhis own pocket, workers say. His underlings continue to\narrange surgery for peasants, loans for teachers and\nvote-buying funds for ward captains.\n   Despite his bitter conflicts with the Aquinos, Danding\nhelped pay for the Boston home in which they lived during\nexile. And while in exile himself a few years ago, Mr.\nCojuangco phoned an ally on the island of Negros -- 28 years\nto the day after the two warlords first hooked up.\n   \"How can you turn your back on a guy like that?\" remarks\nAlfonso Lacson, the recipient of the call. \"I couldn't do\nanything but cry.\"\n   Mrs. Aquino, however, despises Danding. While she doesn't\nbelieve her cousin actually plotted the 1983 murder of her\nlate husband, Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino Jr., she is convinced he\nknew about the plans, confidants say. Danding vehemently\ndenies any knowledge of the plot to kill Ninoy.\n   \"Danding is capable of taking lives,\" says his lawyer,\nGabriel Villareal. \"But he didn't do that.\"\n   Mrs. Aquino, unimpressed by such denials, canceled the\npassports of Danding and his family just after a U.S. jet\nevacuated the Cojuangcos and Marcoses to Hawaii in 1986. Of\nthe nearly $4 billion of corporate assets allegedly stolen by\ncronies of Mr. Marcos and now sequestered by the Aquino\ngovernment, Danding controlled roughly half.\n   Until last fall, Danding lived quietly in exile in\nRiverside, Calif. But on Nov. 26 -- a few days before the\nbloodiest coup attempt against the Aquino government -- he\nslipped back into the Philippines with a passport obtained in\nLos Angeles through some consular officials, who have since\nbeen recalled. Danding announced he had returned to\n\"vindicate my honor and that of my family.\"\n   In a rambling conversation at lunch in his mother's\nsuburban Manila home, Mr. Cojuangco fumes over his treatment\nby the government. He quips that the next president will be\nless vindictive than Mrs. Aquino, as a coterie of his\nbrother, his lawyer, his public-relations man and several\nmaids chuckle nervously. The elegant fish and rice dishes\ncome in waves over a long afternoon. Danding smokes heavily\nbut avoids fatty foods on doctor's orders.\n   His homecoming has thrown Philippine politics into\ndisarray. Most of the same 80 or so powerful clans that\nsupported Mr. Marcos, and presidents before him, still\ncontrol the provinces for Mrs. Aquino. But many members of\nthis political elite resent her advocacy of land reform and\nfear her inability to control the military and provide basic\nservices. Moreover, Mrs. Aquino's promise to step down in\n1992 has sent politicians scurrying for new patrons. Many are\nlining up behind Danding.\n   \"Those who rode on Cory's popularity are facing a serious\ndecision,\" says Rafael Coscolluela, vice governor of the\nprovince of Negros Occidental and an Aquino ally, though now\nedging toward the Cojuangco camp. \"Danding is the only\nobvious opposition candidate who has a chance of winning. But\nhe could be bad for the country in one sense: He'll bring the\npolarization to a head.\"\n   He already has. The sharpest reaction to Danding's return\nhas come from cousin Cory. A few days after Danding arrived,\nshe ordered Solicitor General Francisco Chavez, a slick,\nmachine-gun-toting prosecutor who likens himself to Eliot\nNess, to take personal charge of the government's legal cases\nagainst Mr. Cojuangco. And she publicly suggested that her\ncousin might have been involved in a December putsch that\nleft more than 100 people dead, though she presented no\nevidence. Danding says he had no knowledge that a coup was in\npreparation.\n   He insists he is the victim of political persecution. He\ndefends his management of the coconut business and others,\nconvinced that his creation of cartels helped Filipinos\nextract higher commodity prices from multinational\ncorporations. And he says he doesn't understand why his\nfamily is forbidden to come home.\n   \"They've taken his passport, his assets and now his\nfamily,\" says Selen Saguyod, a judge and Danding disciple.\n   The Cojuangco feud dates back decades. The oldest son of a\nhalf-American mother and a father who died when the boy was\n16, Danding became a maverick within the wealthy Cojuangco\nclan at an early age. While his more-genteel cousins such as\nCory earned degrees in the U.S., Danding dropped out of an\nagricultural college in California and returned home to run\nhis family's businesses.\n   He soon angered relatives by leading a strike against one\nof their sugar mills by planters demanding more money. Some\nyears later, Danding was ousted from a family-run bank and\nforced to sell his shares.\n   In 1965, he ran for Congress against Mrs. Aquino's younger\nbrother, Jose \"Peping\" Cojuangco Jr., under the banner of a\nnew patron, a presidential challenger named Ferdinand Marcos.\nIn an election marked by violence and record vote-buying,\nPeping retained his seat, but Danding helped the new\npresident carry Tarlac province, northwest of Manila.\n   Two years later, Danding was elected provincial governor\nwhen Benigno Aquino, a Marcos enemy, didn't run for\nre-election. As governor, Danding armed vigilante groups to\nfight local Communist insurgents with whom Mr. Aquino had\nbeen on relatively good terms. The cousins tried to make\npeace for a time, but in 1969, the mayors and ward captains\nof Tarlac again had to choose sides when Danding challenged\nPeping for Congress. After some early campaign skirmishes,\nPeping bowed out and Danding won.\n   It was during Marcos martial law, 1972 to 1980, that\nDanding reached the apex of crony capitalism. In 1975, he\ngained control of a Cojuangco bank, First United, when Mrs.\nAquino's family was forced to sell it because of new capital\nrequirements. Danding arranged for the Philippine Coconut\nProducers Federation to buy the Aquino shares at a 100%\npremium -- a family favor since forgotten, friends grouse. He\ntook a 10% stake in the bank himself as a commission, and a\ncontract to manage it.\n   The United Coconut Planters Bank, as it was renamed, grew\ninto one of the most powerful financial institutions in\nSoutheast Asia, thanks to a series of generous presidential\ndecrees. In one, Mr. Marcos extended a levy on the sale of\ncoconut products and mandated that the money be deposited\ninterest-free in the industry's new bank. The levy's\nostensible purpose was to back development projects for the\ncoconut industry. The fund gave Danding control of $500\nmillion, which he managed like a personal fortune.\n   According to government documents, he ingratiated himself\nwith Imelda Marcos, the dictator's wife, by doling out\ncoconut funds to her pet cultural projects and the Miss\nUniverse Pageant (she was once chosen Miss Manila). With levy\nmoney, Danding took a controlling stake in San Miguel Corp.,\nthe Philippines' giant food and beverage conglomerate, and\nthen bankrolled a new chemical company.\n   Above all, though, Danding used the levy funds to buy up\ncoconut-oil mills and create a national milling and trading\ncartel that he controlled. His rationale was simple. Although\nthe Philippines supplied 80% of the world's coconut trade,\nmultinational traders bought the coconut meat -- called copra\n-- from Filipino farmers, waited for prices to rise, and then\nsold for hefty profits to oil millers overseas.\n   Under the system Danding created, farmers were forced to\nsell all copra to his new cartel, which became the sole\nauthorized exporter of coconut oil. The monopoly increased\nhard-currency earnings for millers -- most of whom were\npartners or associates of Danding -- but at the expense of\nsmall coconut farmers.\n   \"Danding monopolized the whole thing,\" says Emmanuel\nPelaez, then a coconut farmer and now Philippine ambassador\nto the U.S. In 1982, Mr. Pelaez was severely wounded in an\nambush after helping some farmers sell their copra directly\nto foreign buyers.\n   Danding didn't stop with coconuts. Once the bank was up\nand running, he made loans to partners and friends in a\nvariety of businesses. He grew particularly enamored of\nmonopolies. He tried creating cartels in rice, sugar, flour,\ngroceries and soft drinks, but ran out of time when \"people\npower\" -- as the popular uprising was called -- overthrew Mr.\nMarcos in 1986.\n   The entire coco-fund empire, including the bank, the oil\nmills and the San Miguel shares, are now under sequestration\nby Mrs. Aquino's special anti-crony commission. The\ngovernment has asked the courts to declare the coconut levy a\n\"public fund,\" which would help clear the way for regulators\nto confiscate the assets. Danding's lawyers counter that the\nfunds came from \"private\" contributions by oil millers, and\nwere invested properly on behalf of the coconut industry.\nThey say the assets belong to farmers, who entrusted them\nwith Danding to manage.\n   The Philippine Supreme Court, in ruling on a motion\nseveral months ago, signaled agreement with the government's\nposition. But it may take years for the nation's plodding\njudiciary to determine the fate of the coco-fund empire. In\nthe meantime, officials responsible for the sequestered\nassets say there is little to prevent Danding from siphoning\nfunds from the properties to help finance his run for the\npresidency. His executives still manage most of the\ncompanies, under loose supervision from low-paid government\nauditors who have more to gain from helping him than foiling\nhim.\n   A Cojuangco reconciliation still isn't out of the\nquestion. Though Mrs. Aquino isn't likely to make peace with\nDanding, her brother, Peping, a congressman and leader of the\nruling party, may. The two cousins, who are about the same\nage, were playmates growing up, and have remained on speaking\nterms over the years despite their political run-ins.\n   People close to both Cojuangco camps say the male cousins\nmay have already agreed to cooperate if Mrs. Aquino doesn't\nrun for re-election. Danding won't comment on such an\nalliance, but he acknowledges that even while he was in\nCalifornia exile, Peping flew there to meet with him. Peping\ndeclined to be interviewed.\n   Danding's supporters aren't waiting to find out if the\nalliance is fact or fiction. Throughout the Philippines, his\nhenchmen are holding local neighborhood meetings. They are\ndrumming up sympathy, much as followers of Ninoy Aquino did a\ndecade ago, for their \"persecuted\" patron. And they are\ncirculating petitions demanding that the boss run for\npresident.\n   Support is building within the Manila business class as\nwell. In the Makati financial district, many Filipino\nexecutives speak of Danding as the one Marcos crony who\nreinvested his money in the Philippines, and whose businesses\nexpanded. He is particularly admired for his staunch\nnationalism: the perception that he tried to throw off the\nyoke of foreign exploitation in the coconut industry.\n   Mrs. Aquino's strategy for clipping her cousin's wings\nrests on the courts. But Danding's people also worry about\nanother force of political suasion: the U.S.\n   In Washington, where congressional support for Mrs. Aquino\nand her \"people power\" revolution has been almost unanimous,\nDanding's resurgence is being met with incredulity.\n   \"Given Danding Cojuangco's intimate involvement in the\nMarcos kleptocracy,\" says Rep. Stephen Solarz, the democrat\nwho chairs a key House subcommittee on Asian affairs, \"it's\nhard to believe the Filipino people would willingly turn the\nreins of government over to him.\"\n   An officer at the U.S. embassy here warns that the\nre-emergence of Marcos cronies would strain relations between\nthe two countries. But Mr. Bosworth, the former ambassador,\nsays that at least initially the U.S. would have to deal with\nDanding \"on a normal and legitimate basis\" if he were\nconstitutionally elected. \"The tone and nature of the\nrelationship would obviously depend on how he governed,\" he\nadds.", "id": "\n900402-0084.", "title": "\n   All in the Family:\n   Closest Marcos Crony\n   Is Favorite to Succeed\n   Aquino in Philippines\n   ---\n   `Danding' Cojuangco Returns\n   From Exile and Disgrace\n   To Spook Cousin Cory\n   ---\n   Coconuts vs. `People Power'\n   ----\n   By Peter Waldman\n   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal"}, "doc\n900402-0066.": {"content": "\n   The information named as defendants the company; its\n56-year-old owner and president, Norman McHaffie, and two\nemployees, James Hicks, 45, and William Whitham, 37.\n   Attorneys for Mr. McHaffie and Mr. Hicks said they hadn't\nseen the information and couldn't comment.

In other cases, he said, patients\nwho might otherwise be paralyzed from the neck down might be\nable to regain some use of their hands because of the new\ntherapy.\n   The study, which featured clinical trials involving\ntreatment of 487 victims of spinal-cord injuries at 10\nmedical centers, was sponsored by the National Institute of\nNeurological Disorders and Stroke, one of the National\nInstitutes of Health. Results will be published in the New\nEngland Journal of Medicine next month.\n   The tests compared 162 patients treated with\nmethylprednisolone; 154 who received naloxone, an\nanti-narcotic addiction drug that tests had suggested might\nhold promise for treating spinal-cord injuries; and 171\npatients receiving a placebo. Six months after their\ninjuries, the patients treated with methylprednisolone showed\nnearly 60% greater improvement in motor skills, and more than\ntwice the improvement in their ability to experience touch,\nthan patients on the placebo. Naloxone didn't turn out to be\nan effective treatment.\n   The key to success is applying massive doses of the drug\nwithin eight hours of an accident, explained Phanor Perot,\nchairman of the department of neurological surgery at the\nMedical University of South Carolina, one of the centers\ninvolved in the study. Doctors gave an initial dose of 30\nmilligrams of methylprednisolone for each kilogram (2.2\npounds) of body weight, followed by an infusion of 5.4\nmilligrams per kilogram per hour for 23 hours. The drugs were\nadministered intravenously.\n   The drugs for this treatment cost about $300.\nMethylprednisolone is made by a number of companies. Upjohn\nCo. donated the amounts used in the institute's study, called\nthe National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study.\n   Spinal injuries rarely sever the spinal cord. Instead,\nthey trigger swelling and a series of chemical reactions that\nover time damage nerve cells in the spinal cord.\nMethylprednisolone arrests some of this disintegration.\nScientists don't know exactly how it works, but they believe\nit improves the blood flow to the injured area and reduces\nswelling. Scientists used methylprednisolone after animal\ntests suggested that it might work on humans.\n   The new therapy has been so successful that the\ninvestigators recommended that doctors start using it to\ntreat spinal cord injuries. In addition, they suggested that\nparamedics could be trained to administer the therapy.\n   Dr. Perot said that the success of the methylprednisolone\ntherapy suggests that there may be other drugs that will\ninterrupt or slow the cell disintegration that damages spinal\ncords in the hours following injuries. \"We may need a whole\nsalad of drugs\" to arrest the cell disintegration process, he\nsaid.\n   Another area of research is focusing on cell grafts and\nregeneration to patch damaged nerve fibers. \"Once you limit\nthe initial damage, the next phase is how to repair it,\"\nexplained Barbara Bregman, a professor of anatomy at\nGeorgetown Univeristy Medical Center.

He fears other men at risk\n\"may be experiencing a higher rate of infection than our\nmen.\"\n   George Lemp, an epidemiologist with the San Francisco\nDepartment of Public Health, found a disturbing rate of\nrelapse in a telephone survey of 400 gay households there.\nAlmost one in five men (18%) said they had had intercourse\nwithout a condom in the past year. Even among those men who\nhad made a commitment never again to engage in unprotected\nsex, 16% said they had slipped in the past year, 12% of them\nwith casual partners.\n   Scientists and activists say they are alarmed but not\nsurprised by some erosion in safe sex. Activist groups in\nseveral major cities have met quietly to discuss educational\nstrategies to deal with relapse. One group, the Gay Men's\nHealth Crisis of New York City, called relapse \"a specter\nhaunting the gay community.\"\n   Many activists explain the phenomenon is similar to the\nexperience of people who try to quit smoking, drinking or\novereating. A slip now and then is inevitable. But \"falling\noff the wagon once won't kill you,\" says San Francisco\nactivist Pierre Ludington. \"Falling off the safe-sex wagon\n{can}.\"\n   Risky encounters carry an especially heavy price in the\nhardest-hit cities like San Francisco, where half of the\ncity's estimated 60,000 gay men are believed to carry the\nvirus. Still, given human nature, the denial of risk dies\nhard.\n   One avowed practitioner of safe sex recently acknowledged\nthe tragic aftermath of a single lapse in a letter to Pat\nChristen, executive director of the San Francisco AIDS\nFoundation. In a recent speech on the problem of relapse, Ms.\nChristen read excerpts from his letter:\n   \"I am one of the people you are talking about,\" the\nunidentified man wrote. \"I practiced only safe activities\nsince 1987. I was not infected, and made a strong\n{commitment} to stay uninfected. Unfortunately, several\nmonths ago, I slipped once. . . . I have never done it since,\nand I slipped just once, but I just found out that I am now\ninfected with the AIDS virus.\" He added, \"I hope you can get\nto others so it's not too late for them.\"\n   Michael DeMayo of the Gay Men's Health Crisis of New York\nCity attributes such slippage to denial, low self-esteem and\nalcohol or drug use. Also, he says that after years of\ndecline in bathhouse attendance, \"there are now a couple\n{underground clubs} in New York where you can go and have\nunsafe sex.\" Other cities also report resurgence of sex\nclubs, although some are said to enforce condom use.\n   The Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center\nreports a rise in sexually transmitted diseases among its\nclinic clients. Psychologist Scott Brooks of the Edmund\nEdelman Health Center clinic says: \"About 30% of our people\nare being diagnosed with some form of gonorrhea.\" Though\nthat's lower than rates of the early 1980's, Mr. Brooks says,\n\"It's most definitely higher than we'd like to see.\"\n   In Seattle, Hunter Handsfield, director of sexually\ntransmitted disease control for the Seattle-King County\nHealth Department, says that city's gonorrhea incidence\nplunged to 33 cases in 1988 from 1,300 cases in 1982. But\nthere was a resurgence in 1989, when cases more than tripled\nto 102.\n   \"We've seen similar rises in every STD -- syphilis,\nherpes, genital warts and chlamydia -- all in gay men,\" he\nadds. \"We have no other rational explanation than that\nthere's been a behavior change,\" that is, a retreat from safe\nsex.\n   In Denver, which had seen an 80% drop in venereal\ndiseases, there's also \"a small increase in gonorrhea in gay\nmen,\" says Gary Sky of the Colorado AIDS project. \"Gays who\nhave been practicing safe sex for years are getting tired of\nit.\"\n   To combat relapse, the Colorado project has published a\npamphlet on how to \"negotiate\" for safe sex. It urges people\nto tell their partners: \"No condom, no sex.\" It also reminds\nthose already infected that unsafe sex places both their\npartner and themselves at risk because any additional assault\non a weakened immune system can accelerate the course of\nAIDS.\n   Older gays, veterans of the epidemic, are \"war weary,\"\nexplains epidemiologist Ron Stall of the University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco. Having succeeded in a massive\nbehavior modification, some gay men found it as hard to\nmaintain as any health regimen. Men in committed\nrelationships sometimes abandon safeguards in the interests\nof intimacy, he adds.\n   On the other hand, younger gay men in their early 20s --\nwho were boys when the epidemic struck a decade ago -- shun\ncondoms because they see AIDS as a problem of the older\n\"leather-bar\" generation, Mr. Stall says, which is a fatal\nillusion. He says if something isn't done, \"I'm afraid we're\ngoing to lose the next generation.\"\n   Gabe Kruks of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community\nServices Center says recent strides in AIDS therapy may have\ngiven lapsers a false sense of security. \"The epidemic isn't\nover,\" he says. \"It's not yet a chronic manageable illness.\"\n   Samuel Broder, National Cancer Institute director and\ndeveloper of such drugs as AZT, DDC and DDI, cautions: \"No\ndrug in existence, or even on the drawing boards, is better\nthan prevention.\"\n   Advocacy groups suggest that education programs have been\nhurt by their own success. AIDS control worked so well among\nwhite gay professionals that it masked a lack of similar\nsuccess among minorities and young men in their teens and\n20s. Funds need to be renewed, programs retargeted, they say.\n   Education programs should stress continuation of safe sex,\npromote role models of healthy intimacy and \"eroticize safe\nsex,\" they say, to make healthy practices desirable, not\nmerely antiseptic.\n   Of course, sexual risk-taking isn't confined to gay men.\nIn a recent letter to the New England Journal of Medicine\nheadlined \"Sex, Lies and HIV,\" two Southern California\nscientists said a survey found Los Angeles area college\nstudents admitted lying regularly about their intimate\nhistories to obtain sex. And the Rev. George Exoo, a gay\nEpiscopal priest in Charleston, S.C., says bisexual married\nmen frequent highway rest stops near his parish for\nclandestine encounters. Activists urge that safe-sex messages\nbe written to reach everyone, not simply urban gays.\n   Programs for young people should break through their sense\nof immunity and immortality, activists add. \"We have to\nrethink our prevention efforts,\" Mr. Stall says. \"Declaring\nvictory and abandoning the field is a recipe for disaster.\"", "id": "\n900402-0150.", "title": "\n   Health:\n   Recent Progress Against the Spread of AIDS\n   Is Threatened by Relapse in Safe-Sex Practices\n   ----\n   By Marilyn Chase\n   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal"}, "doc\n900402-0019.": {"content": "\n   Over the next 90 days, modest growth in the U.S. economy\nand steady interest rates will prevent the dollar from losing\nmuch ground against a more confident yen and the mark,\naccording to the average forecast of 10 currency analysts\nsurveyed by Dow Jones International News Service in Tokyo,\nFrankfurt, London and New York.\n   The average estimate places the dollar at 156.73 yen at\nthe end of April, with the U.S. unit at 155.80 yen by the end\nof June.

Yet Mr. Lutaaya defies this\nprognosis by getting up, recording what would become a hit\nsong about AIDS, and then making the arduous journey back to\nUganda.\n   Yet the message gets more complicated as we follow Mr.\nLutaaya through an itinerary that includes a great many stops\nbesides Gayaza. Part of the fascination of this film (made by\nthe award-winning Canadian film makers Virginia Storring and\nJohn Zaritskyis) is its vivid portrait of contemporary Africa\nas a place where the incursion of the modern world is both a\nblessing and a curse.\n   While still in Kampala, Mr. Lutaaya attends a party in the\nneighborhood bar where he got his start as a musician. Here\nwe are reminded of the extreme moral permissiveness that has\nexisted in urban Africa for the past several decades. This\nparticular gathering is a sober one, but it's clear that the\nbar is usually a spot where the music jumps, the beer flows\nand traditional sexual morality -- whether tribal, Christian\nor Moslem -- falls by the wayside.\n   Such \"liberated\" environments attract young, uprooted\npeople who tend to be malnourished and afflicted with various\nmaladies, including venereal diseases, that have gone\nuntreated since the collapse of the Ugandan health system in\nthe early 1970s. Most researchers agree that it is this\ncombination of unfettered sexual activity and poor health\nthat has caused AIDS to become a heterosexually transmitted\nepidemic in Africa.\n   Therefore, in the spirit of scientific reason, Mr. Lutaaya\ntries to convince people in mosques, churches, remote\nvillages (including his own) and the depopulated \"ghost\ntowns\" along the Trans-African Highway that AIDS is a\npublic-health hazard, not the work of witchcraft or a\npunishment sent by God. He tactfully explains how the virus\nis transmitted, and urges his listeners not to shun or\nmistreat its victims.\n   Here the complications begin, however. By insisting on a\nnon-judgmental attitude, Mr. Lutaaya may be inadvertently\nfurthering the process of secularization that contributed to\nthe problem in the first place. Given the role of religious\ndifferences in Uganda's civil strife, we understand why Mr.\nLutaaya disapproves when a group of youngsters presents him\nwith a song blaming \"rebellious\" and \"promiscuous\" people for\nbringing AIDS into their village, where it now kills the\ninnocent.\n   Yet Mr. Lutaaya is caught on the horns of a dilemma, and\nhe is hardly alone. Public-health officials and religious\nleaders throughout Africa agree that the best weapon against\nAIDS is a return to monogamy, or (in the case of Islam and\ntraditional religions) polygamy, as long as husbands and\nwives both remain faithful. But the only way to restore these\nmoral codes is to strengthen belief, which is also the source\nof superstition and intolerance.\n   Can people adopt strict moral behavior without rendering\nstrict judgment on the behavior of others? In the West, where\nAIDS may not reach epidemic levels, we can afford this kind\nof pragmatic pseudosolution. For us, the horns of the age-old\ndilemma of religious toleration have become comfortably\nblunt. But the same cannot be said of Africa, as this film\nably demonstrates. The fascination, and the sorrow, of Africa\nis that it is a place where all human problems show up with\nthe sharpness of a razor.", "id": "\n900402-0183.", "title": "\n   LEISURE & ARTS -- Television:\n   The Testament of Philly Lutaaya\n   ----\n   By Martha Bayles"}, "doc\n900402-0171.": {"content": "\n   My problem then was the same others covering the war have\nhad -- how to convey this difference to an American audience\nwithin the confines of an op-ed piece. In \"Soldiers of God:\nWith the Mujahidin in Afghanistan\" (Houghton Mifflin, 258\npages, $19.95), Robert D. Kaplan puts it this way: \"These\nwere not the sorts of perceptions that would have survived\nthe brutal reductions of the television camera, the narrow\nboundaries of hard-news writing, or the quantifications of\nthe think-tank analysts in Washington and London.\"\n   Mr. Kaplan, until recently a free-lance reporter based in\nAthens, is also the author of \"Surrender or Starve,\" a book\nabout the barbarous, government-manufactured famine in\nEthiopia, and his experience shows. Indeed, his admitted\nhostility toward other manifestations of Islam makes his\nappreciation of the Afghans all the more impressive.\n   \"(B)ecause Afghans harbored no political insecurities and\nwere more relaxed in their faith than Arabs or Iranians,\" he\nwrites, \"Islam in Afghanistan manifested a certainty and\nunintimidating dynamism that did not exist in Iran, Pakistan,\nor any of the Arab countries I had visited.\"\n   His combination of firsthand war experience inside\nAfghanistan and extensive reporting out of Peshawar -- base\nof the seven-party alliance -- makes him sensitive to\ndistinctions that often escaped even devoted promoters of the\nmuj, local shorthand for the freedom fighters. The Peshawar\ncrowd, often ridiculed the more Westernized mujahedeen, many\nof whom had relatives in Britain and the U.S. The national\nIslamic Front of Afghanistan, for example, was dubbed the\n\"Gucci muj\" and compared unfavorably with more rustic\nwarriors. But \"the fact that members of their families were\nabroad meant that they had other options,\" writes Mr. Kaplan,\nwho wonders whether that makes their decision to stay and\nfight all the more significant.\n   Equally telling are his criticisms of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,\nthe one fundamentalist party leader whose zealous struggle to\nturn Afghanistan into a centrally controlled theocracy\nrecalls the Ayatollah Khomeini. Mr. Hekmatyar has long been\naccused of killing more muj than Soviets, but that never\nstopped a disproportionate share of U.S. aid from flowing\nthrough Pakistan into Mr. Hekmatyar's coffers.\n   Just last week, a report by the House Republican Task\nForce on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare wondered why\nMr. Hekmatyar's party's \"fracticidal fighting against other\nresistance groups, its close and growing cooperation with\nboth Tehran and Kabul, and its active participation in\nanti-U.S. international terrorism\" have had \"little or no\neffect on the delivery of CIA assistance.\"\n   By contrast, there is Abdul Haq, the charismatic self-made\ncommander responsible for the Kabul area, who is often\nunjustly lumped with Mr. Hekmatyar. Though no less devout,\nMr. Haq's vision of Afghanistan couldn't be more distinct: a\ndecentralized, traditional Afghanistan where local rulers\nhold real power. His visit with Margaret Thatcher and Ronald\nReagan, moreover, is credited with Washington's decision to\nprovide the Afghans with the all-important Stinger missiles.\n   \"I told Mrs. Thatcher that my great-grandfather and his\nfather before him fought the British, who invaded Afghanistan\nto keep the Russians out,\" remembers Mr. Haq. \"So I asked\nher: Now that the Russians have finally come, as the British\nonce feared, why are you so quiet?\"\n   Mr. Kaplan rounds out his story with nicely detailed\ndescriptions of the minor but no less colorful types drifting\nthrough Peshawar. There is John Wellesley Gunston, the\nBritish army officer turned photojournalist; Savik Shuster,\nthe Jewish refugee from Lithuania who reported on the war for\nRadio Liberty/Radio Free Europe; Koshiro Tanaka, a Japanese\nwouldbe Rambo whose goal is to kill a Russian with his bare\nhands. At the outset of the book, Mr. Kaplan dismisses many\nof them as \"war freaks.\" But it seems hardly fair for him to\nblast the big-name press and the international organizations\nfor their reluctance to assume great risks and hardships in\ncovering Afghanistan, and then complain about the few hardy\nsouls who did rise, however imperfectly, to that challenge.\n   But this is a quibble with an otherwise first-rate account\nof the determined hillmen who shot the Brezhnev Doctrine full\nof holes, setting the stage for the dramatic events now\nunfolding in Eastern Europe. However harsh the muj could be\non the battlefield, moreover, they did it without the\nterrorist attacks on civilians that characterize most wars of\nnational liberation these days. In the face of the most\npowerful weaponry, the latest strategies and the most modern\nequipment, the stubborn Afghans taught the world an age-old\nlesson.\n   As one of Mr. Kaplan's colleagues put it: \"Had the\nRussians read Kipling more carefully, they might never have\ninvaded Afghanistan.\"\n   ---\n   Mr. McGurn is Washington bureau chief of the National\nReview.", "id": "\n900402-0171.", "title": "\n   LEISURE & ARTS -- Bookshelf:\n   Separating Muj From Mobs\n   ----\n   By William McGurn"}, "doc\n900402-0167.": {"content": "\n   \"If we get the date reinstated, we'll start our proxy\nfight quite soon,\" said John C.

Norton charged that BTR has violated federal\nsecurities laws by, among other things, failing to disclose\n\"its practice and pattern of closing or moving plants and\nlaying off workers after various acquisitions it has made.\"\n   The BTR chief executive said Norton's rejection of the bid\n\"was a very weak response.\" He added: \"Norton made no\nreference to shareholder value, and there is no expectation\nthat Norton can do anything short-term or medium-term\" to\nimprove the company's operating prospects.\n   Mr. Cahill urged Norton's board to provide BTR and other\nNorton holders with whatever information it used to conclude\nthat BTR's bid was inadequate. BTR owns a fractional stake in\nNorton. Mr. Cahill noted that before BTR made its $75-a-share\nbid last month, Norton's share price never had exceeded $64\nin the company's 105-year history.\n   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange\nFriday, Norton closed at $73.50, down 37.5 cents.\n   Mr. Cahill said he expected to meet Massachusetts Sens.\nEdward M. Kennedy and John Kerry in Washington, D.C., this\nweek to try to defuse political opposition to BTR's bid. \"We\nwant to sit down in a spirit of good will and explain the\nbenefits of the bid to Norton and to the city of\nWorcester,\" Mr. Cahill said.\n   He also said BTR would run Norton \"as a free-standing,\nindependent company\" using Norton's current management.\n   He held out the possibility that BTR might make capital\ninvestments in Norton.

After a few days last week of expressing concern\nabout Soviet intimidation, the U.S. toned down its public\ncomments for fear of provoking trouble.\n   And, even in private communications between Secretary of\nState James Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze -- a face-to-face\nmeeting in Africa and a cable last week -- the U.S. has taken\ngreat care to avoid spelling out what a crackdown in\nLithuania would cost Mr. Gorbachev in terms of relations with\nthe U.S.\n   The president's own letter to Mr. Gorbachev late last week\nappears to have been similarly careful. \"The president's\nmessage to President Gorbachev simply reaffirmed our position\nas stated many times,\" White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater\nsaid. He added that it \"clearly stated {the president's}\nsupport and the American support for the aspirations of the\nLithuanian people for self-determination\" -- a statement that\nclearly isn't the same as backing the immediate independence\nthe Lithuanians have declared.\n   Mr. Bush himself said the letter was sent because \"I want\nto be sure that the Soviets understand our position and\nunderstand that we are not trying to make things difficult\nfor Lithuania or for the Soviet Union or anybody else.\"\n   There are three major reasons for this caution. First,\nadministration officials are convinced Mr. Gorbachev will let\nLithuania go peacefully, so long as it can be done gradually,\non Moscow's terms. Second, they argue privately that the\npolitically inexperienced Lithuanian leaders erred by quickly\ndeclaring independence, rather than entering talks with\nMoscow under Soviet law.\n   The president himself said recently: \"There are certain\nrealities in life, the Lithuanians are well aware of them,\nand they should talk, as they are, with the Soviet\nofficials.\"\n   Finally, and most importantly, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker\nprivately admire Mikhail Gorbachev and are convinced they are\nwithin a few months of concluding important business with him\n-- a vast scaling down of Soviet military power, an agreement\nto unite Germany on Western terms, and an opportunity to open\nthe U.S.S.R. to market-based investment.\n   \"We are so close to so much,\" says one very senior\nofficial. \"That's why we want to try to get this Lithuania\nthing behind us.\"\n   This is by far the touchiest moment for foreign policy in\nthe Bush presidency.

The revenue gains\nwould have been stronger, officials said, had Rubbermaid not\nheld back on its retail inventory-building due to concerns\nabout the economy. \"We want merchandise to move through the\nstores, not just get the numbers up,\" Mr. Gault said.\n   In its core housewares division, orders from retailers\nwere \"on the light side\" during the early weeks of the\nquarter but have improved, said Walter W. Williams, president\nand chief operating officer.\n   Despite some worries about the economy, Rubbermaid\ncontinues its fast-paced rate of new product rollouts. The\ncompany unveiled 187 new housewares and specialty products in\nJanuary, including a 50-item line of brooms and brushes.\n   Rubbermaid is optimistic of fast growth in that category,\ndespite the mature state of the market. The reason: larger\nretailers could choose to stock the Rubbermaid line instead\nof buying a variety of products from numerous suppliers.\n   Besides, Rubbermaid hopes to create more demand by\nboosting its advertising and promotion spending on that\nproduct line and others. \"We want to further enhance our\nimage with the consumer,\" Mr. Gault said. Last year's\nadvertising and promotion budget was about 3.6% of sales, or\nabout $45 million.\n   For 1990, that will increase slightly, although the\ncompany officials didn't offer details. One factor is how\nmuch Rubbermaid saves on its raw-material costs. The company\nexpects polyethylene prices to drop during the year as\nsuppliers add capacity to plastic plants.\n   Rubbermaid's Little Tikes toy division is expected to post\nsales gains of between 10% and 12% over the year-ago quarter,\nMr. Williams said. The division's new management is\nconsidering how to expand that business.\n   The company's commercial products business should show\n\"average growth\" in the quarter after lagging behind in 1989,\nMr. Williams said. One factor is the cautious spending among\nfood-service companies and others.\n   For all of 1990, Rubbermaid agrees with analysts' earnings\nestimates of between $1.80 and $1.85 a share, Mr. Gault said,\nwith revenue for the year topping last year's $1.34 billion.\nHowever, the revenue figure won't include about $70 million\nin sales from the housewares business in Europe. Those sales\nare now part of a joint venture that isn't consolidated in\nRubbermaid's income statement.\n   Capital spending is expected to climb 17% to about $100\nmillion in 1990. The increase will cover new product\nintroductions, equipment replacements and other improvements,\nMr. Williams said.\n   During the year, Rubbermaid will focus on management\nsuccession in anticipation of Mr. Gault's retirement in May\n1991.

Haagen\nDazs, Ben & Jerry's and other \"super premium\" ice creams are\nthriving -- as are grocers' own bargain labels -- while basic\nbrands such as Kraft General Foods Corp.'s Sealtest are\nstruggling to hold their ground. Travelers want either cheap\nlodging at chains such as Day's Inn or to sleep in the lap of\nluxury, leaving adequate but unexciting hoteliers such as\nRamada Inn and Holiday Inn in the lurch.\n   \"The mainstream brands of old are increasingly under\npressure from both ends of the spectrum,\" says John Quelch, a\nprofessor at Harvard Business School who specializes in\nconsumer marketing.\n   Adds Ms. Cutler, \"There's no future for products everyone\nlikes a little.\"\n   The murky-middle problem has some roots in demographics.\nThe population growth of the 1940s through 1960s that\nestablished mass-market brands has slowed. And while markets\nhave stopped growing, competition has exploded: The number of\nitems stocked at grocery stores has soared from a few\nthousand 30 years ago to over 40,000 at large supermarkets\ntoday.\n   But the problem goes beyond just population and\ncompetition. Since the early 1970s, families have hardly\nmanaged to boost incomes. For baby boomers starting out,\nthat's made upward mobility more difficult -- hence the need\nfor bargains.\n   At the same time, it's also made them insecure, argues\nFrank Levy, an economist with the University of Maryland's\nSchool of Public Affairs. Feeling their economic status is\nprecarious, middle-class consumers have become loath to\nidentify with middle-road products, often wrapping themselves\nin prestige brands. \"Status anxiety makes niche marketing\nvery attractive,\" Mr. Levy says.\n   This emphasis on image -- not to mention a foreign\ninvasion -- has put Smirnoff vodka on the defensive. The\ndomestic brand, a product of Grand Metropolitan PLC's\nHeublein Inc., sells for a moderate $6 to $9 a bottle and\nfaces growing competition from a horde of imported, heavily\nadvertised rivals, led by Carillon Importers Ltd.'s Absolut.\nLast year, U.S. sales of all high-priced imported vodkas,\nincluding Stolichnaya, Finlandia, Icy and Tanqueray Sterling,\nrose more than 20%.\n   Smirnoff remains the nation's best-selling vodka, but unit\nsales barely grew at all last year, according to Al Sanchez,\nmanager of research and statistics for Jobson Publishing\nCorp.'s alcoholic beverage unit. To keep from slipping,\nSmirnoff has been attempting to strengthen its image of\nquality by raising prices and running ads with a more upscale\nlook. The company is also pursuing a counterattack, pressing\nfor more sales overseas.\n   If a middle-price product can't sell on prestige, it has\nto compete on value. To make Sealtest stand out from\nstore-brand ice creams, Paul Litwack, marketing director for\nfrozen desserts at Kraft, has borrowed some tactics from\nfancier brands. It recently added a layer of cellophane\ninside the carton -- like the one found in Breyers, a sister\nbrand -- to slow formation of ice crystals. Kraft, a unit of\nPhilip Morris Cos., also made the package's graphics cleaner\nand more modern. The idea is to keep the price the same,\nabout $2.99 a half gallon, but come across to consumers as a\nbetter value. Still, the product remains in that not-cheap,\nnot-expensive limbo. Says Mr. Litwack: \"It's a very tough\ncategory.\"\n   An average image also haunts retailers J.C. Penney Co. and\nSears, both of which have seen their middle-income customers\ndefect to discount outlets or trendier specialty stores. Both\nchains are scrambling to revitalize sales by trying to\nproject an image that's a step up from vanilla. They are\nstocking more national-brand goods and running slicker, more\nstylish ads to herald the change.\n   Sears maintains its program has been successful in\nstrengthening its image with consumers. Unfortunately,\nperceptions die hard. Despite its much-ballyhooed name-brand\nstrategy, Sears's profits are flagging. \"Sears doesn't stand\nfor anything customers aspire to,\" says John Lister,\nexecutive vice president at Lister Butler Inc., a New York\nimage consultant.\n   Technology has worked against some middle marketers by\ngiving a boost to cheap rivals. Seiko Corp. of America, a\nunit of Hattori Seiko Co., introduced quartz technology in\n1969. In no time, Seiko was faced with threatening,\nlow-priced competition from Timex Corp., Swatch Watch Corp.\nand other companies that could use highly precise quartz\ntechnology in timepieces selling for under $50. \"There's no\nreason to spend more than $100 on a watch unless you're\nlooking for diamonds and gold,\" says C. Michael Jacobi, vice\npresident of marketing and sales at Timex.\n   Then, with the advent of the yuppie mentality,\nstatus-oozing Rolex and PatekPhilippe watches took a bite\nfrom the top.\n   Seiko has responded by expanding its lines beyond the\nmiddle. It now sells the pricey Lassale and the inexpensive\nLorus. It's also trying to blend fashion with its traditional\nclaim of superior technology. A snappy $325 analog model, for\nexample, shows the time in 21 different cities.\n   Although Seiko maintains it has hung on to about half of\nthe midpriced segment, the business \"has been no bed of\nroses,\" says Joe Whall, a Seiko spokesman.\n   \"It's hard for middle-segment watches to compete either on\nelegance or on price,\" says Robert Schmidt, chairman of\nLevine, Huntley, Schmidt & Beaver Inc., the agency that, in\n1987, created some stylish ads for midpriced Citizen Watch\nCo. set to the music of Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. \"We\nused style to make people feel good about wearing them.\" He\nsays sales of the brand, virtually unknown at the time,\nsoared to two million units annually, from a scant 200,000.\n   Despite the success of the ads, Citizen discontinued them\nlast year and switched agencies. Now, the brand seems to have\nlost its momentum. Executives at Citizen couldn't be reached\nfor comment.\n   For some, it finally gets to the point where the middle\nmarket just isn't worth it. Marriott Corp. tried to string\nits Bob's Big Boy, Allie's and Wag's coffee shops into a\nsingle, national chain of casual restaurants. It was a\nnebulous niche that few consumers wanted: The restaurants\nweren't as cheap or as appealing to children as fast food.\nNor could they please adults with a nice dining-out\natmosphere. Last December, the hotel chain announced plans to\nquit the restaurant business.\n   \"We were sandwiched in the middle,\" a Marriott spokesman\nsays. \"It would have been too costly to establish a new\nnational brand.\"\n   In the hotel industry, where chains have spread rapidly,\ncompanies are trying to extend their reach both into cheaper\naccommodations and higher-priced ones. Holiday Corp.'s\nHoliday Inns, which no longer has the casual family traveler\nall to itself, has added a more upscale entry called Holiday\nInns Crowne Plaza. Ramada Inn now operates a low-frills\nproperty called Rodeway Inns and a posher chain called\nRenaissance.\n   Prime Motor Inns Corp., which operates Ramada's U.S.\nfranchise system and owns or franchises such chains as Howard\nJohnson, maintains there is still opportunity to serve\nmiddle-market customers. The trick, it says, is to\ndistinguish itself from midrange competitors. So Prime has\nbegun building suite hotels, called AmeriSuites and\nPlaza-Suite Hotels. Chris Browne, senior vice president of\nmarketing and reservations for Prime's franchise systems\ndivision, says the company scrimped on common areas and nixed\nroom service in order to offer rooms with amenities such as\ntwo phones, a microwave and a refrigerator, all at the same\nprice as Holiday Inns.\n   Prime predicts an industry shakeout, and expects to\nsurvive. Until then, he says, \"If you sit still and do\nnothing, you'll be devoured.\"\n   The middle isn't nearly as amorphous for many\npackaged-goods makers, where there is often less opportunity\nto develop prestige brands. But few marketers would dispute\nthat their business is more complex and more competitive than\never.

Their\nnear-term bet is that short-term rates will fall a bit while\nlong-term rates stay where they are or even rise. If that\nhappens, many of the shares of well-run savings-and-loan\nassociations and financing companies that can buy money\ncheaply and lend it more expensively could benefit, according\nto Nancy Spady, analyst at Morgan Stanley.\n   But investors should venture cautiously into thrift\nstocks, Ms. Spady says. \"You really want to focus on the\nsingle-family housing lenders,\" she says. She is recommending\nthree: H.F. Ahmanson, Great Western Financial and Golden West\nFinancial.\n   Poor first-quarter performers included banks with suspect\nloan portfolios, insurance companies with suspect bond\nportfolios and highly leveraged companies of any type. But\nsome good companies were tarred, and investors are beginning\nto differentiate the good financial stocks from the bad.\n   \"We have begun to purchase selected insurance stocks such\nas General Re and Chubb,\" says William Kufta, senior vice\npresident at Pitcairn Financial Management. Mr. Kufta also is\n\"looking for values\" and preparing to buy bank stocks. \"We're\ndoing our best to identify the true risks in loan\nportfolios,\" he adds.\n   In another category, Joseph McAlinden, director of\nresearch at Dillon Read, thinks basic materials stocks will\noutperform the market in the months ahead. Last quarter, the\nbasic materials sector, which includes companies such as\nAluminum Co. of America and Union Carbide, lagged behind the\nDow Jones Equity Market Index of 704 stocks.\n   \"Companies that are sensitive to GNP {gross national\nproduct, or a nation's total value of goods and services} can\nbe risky as we go into the second quarter,\" Mr. McAlinden\nconcedes. But he argues that companies have just about worked\noff once-bloated raw materials inventories. Soon, they will\ngo back out into the market and start bidding up prices for\ncopper, aluminum and other essential industrial commodities,\nhe says.\n   \"You want to be emphasizing the materials companies now,\"\nhe says, adding: \"Amax in the aluminum stocks, and copper\nstocks such as Phelps Dodge.\"\n   What about the dollar's recent strength? Won't that make\nU.S. basic materials producers less competitive?\n   \"It's not that you have had a strong dollar but a weak\nyen,\" he says. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar is\nnot significantly higher, he asserts.\n   ---\n   Friday's Market Activity\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Stocks closed lower and ended the first quarter with the\nlightest weekly volume in three months.

But the hot point of contention was the\ntiming of Supreme Court review.\n   When it passed the law, Congress included a provision\ncalling for expedited review by the high court. Based on that\nprovision, after federal judges in Seattle and the District\nof Columbia declared the law unconstitutional, the Bush\nadministration on March 14 urged the high court to put the\nappeal on a fast track for argument this month -- even though\nthe usual deadline for April hearings had passed.\n   In contrast, the House brief had said Congress simply\nmeant that the court should \"give the case priority when it\ndevises its argument calendar for October.\"\n   House Republican leaders provoked the vote to withdraw the\nbrief, complaining that they weren't consulted on it, and\nfocusing on the brief's suggestion that there was no need for\nthe high court to rush to hear the case this spring.\n   The vote came to be seen as an election-year test of\nlawmakers' commitment to protecting the flag.

Middle-class areas filled with\nhomes that had been confiscated for use by government\nloyalists voted for the Sandinistas. Many of the city's poor\nbarrios, however, rejected them. \"In Monsonor Lezcano, UNO\nwon two to one,\" Barricada reported mournfully. In working\nclass San Judas, a Sandinista stronghold, UNO nearly won. The\nday after the vote, Reuters reported, barrio residents burned\nthe Sandinista flag in the streets.\n   The isolated southern area along Nicaragua's Caribbean\ncoast is probably the poorest region in the country. It gave\nUNO more than 60% of the vote, its second-highest result in\nany region. By way of contrast, the Rio San Juan area\nbordering Costa Rica, perhaps the richest in Nicaragua, gave\nthe Sandinistas 58% of the vote and their best showing.\n   In the area where the most severe contra fighting took\nplace, around Matagalpa and Jinotega, the Sandinistas claimed\nvoters would give them a landslide victory to express their\noutrage at the U.S.-backed contra war. Instead, UNO won 58%\nof the vote, the Sandinistas only 36%.\n   Nicaragua's results should have prompted Western observers\nto question media reports from East Germany that claimed\nvoters wanted to retain large elements of socialism. Carl\nBernstein, writing in Time magazine in January, said he\n\"could hardly find any citizens who said they wanted a\nreunified, single Germany.\" He reported that \"they love their\ncountry. The German Democratic Republic, not the Federal\nRepublic of the West. They believe in socialism. Still.\"\n   Mr. Bernstein could file this amazing dispatch only\nbecause his interviews were done in East Berlin, the one part\nof East Germany that clearly resisted the free market tide in\nfavor of rapid unification. The reform Communist Party won\n30% of the vote in Berlin and the leftish Social Democrats\n(SPD) and Alliance 90 another 41%. In the rest of the\ncountry, the parties of the left won only 36% of the vote.\nThe high Berlin vote for the left reflected the high number\nof Communist Party functionaries, court intellectuals and\npolicemen in the capital.\n   Some Western analysts have attributed the conservatives'\nvictory to their supposedly massive rural support, but the\nresults indicate otherwise. Conservatives ran behind the vote\nfor the parties of the left in the most rural regions of the\ncountry.\n   But the conservatives triumphed in the densely populated\nindustrial areas of Thuringia and Saxony, the prewar\nheartland of German socialism. The left won only 26% of the\nvote in the Dresden district, and in the soot-begrimed\nindustrial region of Karl Marx Stadt, only 29%. Erfurt, where\nthe Social Democratic Party issued its political program in\n1891, gave the SPD only 19% of the vote.\n   The Social Democrats did poorly in part because many\nworkers harbored bitter memories of the years during which\nthe West German Social Democrats cooperated with the\nCommunist regime of Erich Honecker. \"As time went on, the SPD\ncame to identify helping East Germans with helping the\nCommunist Party,\" bricklayer Olaf Wohlleben told John Barnes\nof the Detroit News. Overall, exit polls showed that 60% of\nworking-class voters plumped for the conservatives and what\nWest German pollster Wolfgang Hartenstein called West German\nChancellor Helmut Kohl's \"petit bourgeois certainties.\"\n   Support for those same values dominated Hungary's\nelections last week. The two leading parties, Democratic\nForum and the Free Democrats, disagree only on how rapidly to\nmove to a market economy. Together they won nearly half the\nvote. The Socialists and Communists won a total of 15% and\nwere swamped by the pro-market Free Democrats, even in the\npoorer areas of Budapest.\n   Despite this sweeping repudiation of socialism, it would\nbe an exaggeration to say a majority of people in these\ncountries have become convinced capitalists. People are\nvoting not only for a different political and economic\nsystem, but also to make their societies less political. When\nLech Walesa visited the Journal last November, he was asked\nwhat the Polish people wanted. \"We want to rejoin the ranks\nof normal societies,\" he said. \"It isn't an issue of\nideology, it simply means we want a system where politics\nisn't everything and people can live normal lives.\"\n   Having lived in countries where every aspect of life from\nuniversity exams to child care was politicized, voters in\nEastern Europe and elsewhere are embracing a little-heralded\nfeature of the free society -- the freedom not to be obsessed\nwith political questions. They can instead immerse themselves\nin family, career, church or self-improvement. In normal\nsocieties people may forget about politics and concentrate on\nthe serious business of living. Socialism even in its most\nbenign form is a bureaucratic committee meeting that never\nends.\n   ---\n   Mr. Fund is an editorial writer for the Journal.", "id": "\n900402-0189.", "title": "\n   World's Workers\n   Are Uniting...\n   For Capitalism\n   ----\n   By John H.

Actually, this\nwell-established doctrine has been around a long time. It\nholds you responsible, for example, if you give money to a\nmass murderer so he can buy a machine gun. In the Wilson\ncase, here's what Mr. Crovitz left out: The old lady funded\nher relative's purchase of a car, knowing he had flunked a\ndriver's test, had no driver's license, had no insurance and\nhad an alcohol and drug problem. He paralyzed his passenger\nwhen he drove the car off a bridge.\n   The \"railroad worker\" awarded nearly $500,000 because she\nwas asked to take a drug test. Mr. Crovitz left out that she\nwas a lowly computer operator who had nothing to do with the\noperation of trains. She was a six-year employee in good\nstanding, with no history of drug or alcohol abuse. For\nrefusing to take the urine test, she was fired. The company\npromised her a hearing, but reneged.

However, I want to set the record\nstraight in one particular, since you mentioned me and my\nhorrendous battle with the FTC in the 1970s. You mentioned\nthat my \"Cooga Mooga family business\" had something to do\nwith an acne product, and I certainly understand why you\nwould have that impression, thanks to the many\nmisrepresentations by the press and the FTC itself. But for\nfuture reference, the fact is my four daughters had used a\nvery good skin-care product called Acne Statin, produced by a\ndoctor here in Beverly Hills, who asked me to do a commercial\nfor her product.\n   Since I knew it was a good product, based on the\nexperience of my own teenage girls, and since the woman had\nno money to pay me for my commercials, we agreed to a\n25-cent-per-bottle compensation. That seemed fair, because if\nthe commercial worked, we'd all benefit -- and if people\nweren't interested, we would all have to forget about it. As\nit turned out, the commercial (made with my then-unfamous\nteen-age daughter Debby) was extremely successful, and the\nproduct took off like wildfire.\n   Enter the FTC, egged on by a competitor, a doctor and\nothers interested in the now famous Retin A. Knowing the Acne\nStatin doctor had not done the required double-blind clinical\nstudies on her product (as a naturalized citizen she was\nafraid someone would steal her unpatentable formula), the\ncompetitors made charges to the FTC and offered to do their\nown clinicals -- roughly like having Chevrolet assess the new\nFord.\n   An ambitious young lawyer went for it, seeing the chance\nto clamp down on celebrity endorsements and make a name for\nhimself. He convinced my attorney that I should sign a\nconsent decree, not admitting to anything (because I wasn't\nreally charged with anything) but not doing any further ads\nfor the product until the doctor's clinical studies had been\ndone. The lawyer guaranteed my name would be kept out of the\npapers if I would cooperate. But as soon as I signed the\ndecree, he called a news conference and trumpeted his\naccomplishment. It hit papers and wire services all over the\nworld and sent tremors through Madison Avenue. And though the\nAcne Statin doctor did clinical studies that substantiated\nevery claim that had been made -- she and her product were\nruined, and I have rarely been asked to do a commercial\nsince.\n   Though the opposing doctor and the Retin A people had some\ninitial success, recently a lot of questions were raised\nabout the efficacy of their products, and the Acne Statin\ndoctor has for years been trying to alert the medical\ncommunity and the public to possible cancer connections with\ncontinued use of Retin A.\n   Pat Boone\n   Burbank, Calif.", "id": "\n900402-0011.", "title": "\n   Letters to the Editor:\n   Celebrity Ads: Truth or Consequences"}, "doc\n900402-0023.": {"content": "\n   Italian politicians, shocked by a rash of road deaths\ninvolving people driving home after all-night revels, are\npreparing a campaign to curb drunken driving and limit the\nuse of fast cars by young people.\n   A decree expected to be approved by the cabinet this month\nallows police to administer tests for drunken driving.

Philippe Le\nTixerant, spokesman for the association of growers and\nproducers, said the vineyard owners had pledged 43% of the\ntotal champagne crop to producers, the lowest amount they\nhave ever contracted to sell.\n   Private vine growers are seeking to cash in on the rapidly\nexpanding market by producing and marketing their own\nchampagne instead of selling their grapes to the major\nhouses.\n   The Comite Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne, the\nproducers' trade association, meets today to try to salvage\nan agreement and prevent what major producers say could be\nanarchy in the champagne market.\n                                                                                                       \n\n   POSTSCRIPTS . . .\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Addressing the opening session of the First International\nConference on Environmental Protection of the Himalayas, Sir\nEdmund Hillary warned that the mountains were threatened by\ndeforestation and tourism. \"The living standards {of the\nHimalayan people} are increasing,\" he said, \"but the\nbeautiful tracks and valleys have been littered and the\nforests destroyed.\" . . .

Operating rates can exceed\n100% because some mills may operate for a limited period at\nhigher capacity than that for which they are rated.\n   For the first two months of this year, Canadian mills\nproduced 1,180,000 metric tons of market pulp, a 4.5% decline\nfrom 1,236,000 tons a year earlier. The industry operated at\n95% of capacity in the first two months, down from 103% a\nyear earlier.\n   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to\nproducers of paper, sanitary and other products.

Thus, manufacturers and distributors typically\ndisagree bitterly over how much of the total liability each\nis responsible for.\n   By keeping the contributions secret, the idea is to\nprevent the defendants from backing out after comparing the\nsize of their contributions against their estimates of their\nown liability. Securities laws allow publicly held companies\nto disclose aggregate numbers only for all legal costs to\npreserve the confidentiality of individual settlements.\n   \"I am increasingly optimistic that what we have here in\nMaryland is going to be a model nationwide,\" said Kenneth R.\nFeinberg, a Washington lawyer who was appointed special\nmaster in the cases in October. Mr. Feinberg, a partner at\nKaye, Scholar, Fierman, Hays & Handler, was assigned to\nconstruct an out-of-court system to compensate victims of\nexposure to asbestos, a widely used fire-resistant fiber that\ncan cause various lung diseases, including cancer.\n   Keeping the individual contributions and the aggregate\nfund \"blind,\" said Mr. Feinberg, is the glue holding the\npackage together: \"That's the only way you can get these\nparties to cooperate.\"\n   Other states -- including New York, California, Florida\nand Texas -- have been looking to Maryland for a potential\nsolution to backlogs of asbestos litigation. Because federal\ncourts and most state courts don't permit asbestos injury\nsuits to proceed as so-called class actions, tens of\nthousands of cases nationwide must proceed individually or in\nsmall groups, eating up already burdened court time and\nresources.\n   The plan, which hasn't been approved by all of the 85\ndefendants facing asbestos claims in Maryland, offers several\nadvantages for plaintiffs and defendants, said Edward Houff,\nan asbestos defense lawyer in Baltimore who represents 22\ndefendants. It provides predictability and consistency in the\nsettlement amounts while avoiding delay and risk of jury\ntrials.\n   Mr. Feinberg, who helped engineer settlements for mass\nclaims in litigation over the Agent Orange defoliant and the\nDalkon Shield birth-control device, said he will recommend\nsettlement amounts for specific illnesses from exposure to\nasbestos, but that the final decision will be up to Baltimore\nCity Circuit Judge Marshall A. Levin, who appointed Mr.\nFeinberg.\n   If the plan proceeds, each defendant company will make a\ncontribution to Peter Angelos, the Baltimore plaintiff's\nlawyer who is handling 90% of the claims. Mr. Angelos, in\nturn, will administer the fund and make payments to his\nclients. All clients, said Mr. Angelos, have the option of\npursuing their suits in court rather than claiming a share of\nthe fund.\n   Mr. Feinberg said a final agreement for the plan, which\nwould compensate all asbestos claims filed up to Sept. 1,\n1990, requires the defendants to pay the amounts they have\nagreed to and the plaintiffs to accept the settlement\namounts. For future claims, an effort would be made to change\nMaryland court rules to require new asbestos claimants to try\narbitration before litigating their claims. The latter point\ncould prove difficult.\n   Said Mr. Angelos: \"We will not agree to anything that\nerects a barricade between a plaintiff and a courthouse.\"\n   ---\n   GAF SENTENCE includes prison time for Vice Chairman James\nT. Sherwin.\n   A federal judge in New York sentenced Mr. Sherwin to six\nmonths in prison and fined the company $2 million for\nconvictions of criminal stock manipulation and securities\nfraud.\n   On Friday U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe, who\npresided over the GAF trial last year, said it was her duty\nto sentence the GAF executive to a prison term \"as a lesson\nto others who may be tempted to violate the laws that deal\nwith the {financial} markets.\" The judge also sentenced Mr.\nSherwin to one year of probation following his time behind\nbars.\n   Stephen E. Kaufman, one of Mr. Sherwin's lawyers, urged\nthe judge to sentence his client to community service\nbecause, \"This was an aberrational act, an isolated act, an\nact totally out of character with anything he's done in his\nlife.\" The government didn't recommend a specific jail term\nfor Mr. Sherwin but said a \"substantial sentence\" was\nwarranted. Lawyers for Mr. Sherwin and GAF said they will\nappeal the sentences.\n   In the case, the government charged that Mr. Sherwin asked\nthe Los Angeles brokerage firm Jefferies & Co. to purchase\nshares of Union Carbide Corp. in October 1986 at a certain\nprice. The request, prosecutors claimed, was part of a scheme\nto push up the stock price just as GAF was preparing to sell\noff millions of Carbide shares. Last December jurors returned\na verdict of guilty on all counts against Mr. Sherwin and\nGAF.\n   After the sentencing, Mr. Sherwin, a 56-year-old lawyer\nwho was once the nation's third ranking chess player,\ndeclined to comment. Looking somber, he embraced his tearful\nwife and five of his children. He will remain free, pending\nthe appeal of the sentence.\n   The sentencing of Mr. Sherwin and GAF effectively marks\nthe end of the cases brought to the government's door by\nformer brokerage chief Boyd L. Jefferies. Mr. Jefferies, who\nwas implicated by former arbitrageur Ivan F. Boesky, in turn\npointed the finger at Mr. Sherwin and GAF, as well as\ncorporate takeover specialist Paul A. Bilzerian and former\nstock speculator Salim B. Lewis.\n   Early in the summer, the government won a criminal\nsecurities conviction against Mr. Bilzerian, who was later\nsentenced to four years in prison. In August, Mr. Lewis\npleaded guilty to three felony counts and was sentenced to\nthree years' probation and $250,000 in fines.\n   Last month, GAF agreed to settle a related civil suit\nfiled by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the\nsettlement, the firm will pay the government $1,250,000 as\nwell as interest in excess of $400,000.\n   ---\n   LISA JONES'S CONVICTION is upheld, but appeals court\norders new sentencing.\n   Ms. Jones, 27, was convicted last year of five counts of\nperjury and two counts of obstruction of justice for lying to\na federal grand jury in Manhattan, N.Y. The grand jury was\nlooking into allegations of illegal trades between Drexel\nBurnham Lambert Inc. and Princeton/Newport Limited\nPartnership. Ms. Jones, a former assistant trader at Drexel,\ndenied in her testimony that she knew about the transactions.\n   The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Ms.\nJones's claims that her convictions should be overturned\nbecause of alleged conflicts of interest by her trial lawyer,\nwho also represented other Drexel employees. But the appeals\npanel said the trial judge, Leonard Sand, improperly\nincreased Ms. Jones's sentence under federal sentencing\nguidelines.\n   At the prosecutors' request, Judge Sand boosted Ms. Jones\nto a higher penalty level under the guidelines because her\nperjury allegedly caused the government to spend more money\nthan it otherwise would have in its investigation of\nPrinceton/ Newport. As a result, Ms. Jones faced a sentence\nof 18 to 24 months, instead of 10 to 16 months. The appeals\ncourt said the judge should have stuck to the lower\nsentencing level, and it sent the case back to Judge Sand for\nresentencing. No date has been set for the new sentencing.\n   \"Apparently it was the view of the district court that\nthese instances of perjury resulted in substantial\nexpenditures of governmental resources,\" the appeals court\nwrote. \"No such expenditures have been demonstrated.\" The\ncourt said Ms. Jones's perjury didn't deprive the government\nof any information it didn't already have from other sources.\n   Daniel Bookin, an attorney for Ms. Jones, declined to\ncomment. He said no decision has been made on whether to\nappeal the conviction further.\n   At the resentencing, the government could again ask for\nthe tougher sentence if it presented evidence that the\nperjury resulted in substantial additional costs. A\nspokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office said, \"It's\ninappropriate at this time to discuss what the government\nwill do at the time of sentencing.\"\n   ---\n   FORMER DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION CHIEF didn't have\nconflict of interest in Eastern Airlines case, court rules.\n   A federal appeals court rejected a pilots union claim that\nJames H. Burnley, former DOT secretary, violated conflict of\ninterest laws in Eastern's labor-management struggle.\n   A three-member panel of the federal appeals court in\nWashington, D.C., declined to review Mr. Burnley's December\n1988 decision against conducting a broad-based investigation\nof Eastern's operations. The Air Line Pilots Association\ncharged that Mr. Burnley ruled against the inquiry, which\nwould have been Eastern's second that year, as he was being\ncourted by a law firm that represents the carrier on other\nmatters.\n   Mr. Burnley left his post as DOT secretary to become a\npartner at the Washington law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts &\nTrowbridge in January 1989. Although Mr. Burnley was\nnegotiating for the partnership while deciding the Eastern\nmatter, a department ethics official said Mr. Burnley could\nrule on the matter because Shaw Pittman wasn't representing\nEastern during that proceeding. A second review by Mr.\nBurnley's successor as transportation secretary, Samuel\nSkinner, also concluded Mr. Burnley had violated no laws or\nregulations.\n   A spokesman for the pilots' association said he wasn't\nsure if the union would seek a further appeal. Mr. Burnley\ncouldn't be reached.\n   ---\n   ATTORNEY-CLIENT SECRECY is protected in fees case.\n   A federal appellate court panel upheld a ruling in favor\nof a Chicago lawyer who fought a grand-jury subpoena\nrequesting the source of his fees, on the basis that such\ninformation represents privileged attorney-client\ncommunications.\n   U.S. District Judge Joel M. Flaum, writing the opinion for\nthe Seventh U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago, emphasized that\nthe decision isn't meant to broaden the attorney-client\nprivilege. But when communications are confidential, the\nprivilege is essential \"to the proper functioning of our\nadversary system,\" Judge Flaum said.\n   The case involved David Cherney, who was subpoenaed to\ntestify before a federal grand jury and identify the person\nwho paid him the legal fees of another individual, who had\nbeen named in a federal drug-conspiracy indictment. The\nunidentified third-party fee payer also consulted Mr. Cherney\ninvolving the fee payer's own possible involvement in the\nconspiracy.\n   \"It is quite obvious that the government wants to learn\nthe identity of the feepayer so that it can bring a suspected\ndrug felon to justice,\" Judge Flaum said. \"Nevertheless, the\ngovernment's interests in this instance must give way to\nthose served by the attorney-client privilege.\"\n   Last week's unanimous ruling by the three-member appeals\ncourt panel drew praise from the National Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers, which has battled what it views as\nattempts by the government to erode that privilege.", "id": "\n900402-0033.", "title": "\n   Law -- Legal Beat:\n   Plan to Settle Maryland Asbestos Claims May Be Model\n   ----\n   By Milo Geyelin and Wade Lambert\n   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal"}, "doc\n900402-0122.": {"content": "\n   In Canada, the world's largest exporter of pulp and paper,\nthe outlook isn't any brighter. \"There will be more earnings\ndisappointments than the Street expects,\" said Brian F. Topp,\nan analyst with Capital Group Securities in Toronto. \"I think\nthings will get progressively worse this year,\" Mr. Topp\nsaid. He said he expects Canadian producers as a group to\nreport lower earnings in all four quarters of 1990, compared\nwith year-earlier levels, and expects earnings for the year\nto be down 50%.\n   The biggest change for North American producers in the\nfirst quarter was the spreading of price discounting to the\npremium grade of market pulp, known as Northern bleached\nsoftwood kraft pulp. For the first time in three years,\ndiscounts from list prices were readily available, analysts\nand industry sources said.\n   Prices began slipping in January as producers' shipments\ndropped to a five-year low and inventories shot up. Although\nthe current discounts of $15-$30 a metric ton from the list\nprice of $830 a metric ton aren't yet painful, they are\nbelieved to presage much bigger discounts. A metric ton is\n2,204.6 pounds. Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open\nmarket to makers of paper and sanitary and other products.\n   Prices for lower-quality grades of market pulp began\nsliding last year, and discounting accelerated in the first\nquarter. Prices for the lower grades took \"a very significant\ndrop\" of about $50 a metric ton in the first quarter, one\nproducer said, and are now about $100 a metric ton, or 12% to\n14%, below list prices.\n   Analysts expect pulp prices to fall further this year and\nagain next year because several producers will be starting\nnew mills. Mr. Topp said that in a worst-case scenario the\nprice of Northern bleached softwood pulp could bottom out at\nabout $550 a metric ton, or more than 30% below current\nlevels, by the end of this year or the beginning of 1991.\n   Analysts said Weyerhaeuser Co., Federal Paper Board Co.,\nGeorgia-Pacific Corp. and International Paper Co. are among\nthe U.S. producers with a major exposure to market pulp and\nare expected to report lower earnings. Major Canadian\nproducers of market pulp include Noranda Forest Inc., Repap\nEnterprises Inc., Canfor Corp., Canadian Pacific Forest\nProducts Ltd. and Fletcher Challenge Canada Ltd., a\nsubsidiary of Fletcher Challenge Ltd. of New Zealand.\n   Newsprint makers were hit early and hard by price\ndiscounting, and after a two-year slide, producers are trying\nto nudge prices back up. Led by Abitibi-Price Inc., most\nmajor newsprint producers announced they will raise the U.S.\nEast Coast list price by $35 a metric ton to $685 a metric\nton, effective June 1. The pricing structure is slightly\ndifferent in the West, where newsprint makers are seeking a\ncomparable increase.\n   But producers don't expect customers to actually pay $685\na metric ton for newsprint. Instead they are trying to lift\nthe discounted or transaction price from about $525 to $540 a\nmetric ton to around $560 to $575.\n   Newspaper publishers are somewhat sympathetic to the\nnewsprint makers' pleas for relief -- Abitibi said in\nannouncing the price increase that it runs a loss on every\nton of newsprint it sells.\n   But with newsprint in abundant supply, publishers and many\nanalysts doubt the increase will stick. \"If the suppliers\nstick together,\" said James Correu, director of operations at\nthe Dallas Morning News, the list price increase might go\nthrough. But, he said, \"we've already had overtures from some\nsuppliers about special discounting\" that would leave\ntransaction prices unchanged.\n   The one wild card for newsprint and pulp suppliers and\nbuyers is the prospect of a strike in Eastern Canada.\nContracts at most mills in the region expire April 30, and\nthe Canadian Paperworkers Union is seeking substantial wage\ngains. \"If a prolonged strike takes hold, then transaction\nprices will increase,\" Mr. Topp of Capital Group said.\n   Markets for other major forest commodities also softened\nin the first quarter, but prices for a few products remained\nfirm.\n   In packaging grades, bleached board prices showed\nstrength, analysts said. Transaction prices for linerboard\ndropped to $380 a short ton from a list price of $410 a short\nton, but \"nobody seems to be expecting that prices are going\nto continue slipping from there,\" one analyst said.\n   Prices for photocopy paper, business forms and other\nuncoated white papers are about 10% to 15% below list prices,\nbut a 5% price increase that went into effect at the start of\nthis month is expected to halt the discounting.\n   In coated papers, prices for the fanciest grades are\nholding up well. List prices for coated magazine paper are\nbeing discounted about 5%, analysts said, with little\nprospect of a price increase.\n   One bright spot is building products. The lumber market is\n\"pretty healthy,\" a Weyerhaeuser spokesman said. Weyerhaeuser\nis also a major producer of other products such as pulp and\nhas interests in financial services and real estate.\n   \"Overall, the year will be down somewhat from 1989,\" the\nspokesman said, but first-quarter earnings will \"probably be\npretty close\" to analysts' estimates of 50 to 55 cents a\nshare, compared with 70 cents a share a year earlier.\n   That decline is in line with the 19% year-on-year drop in\nfirst-quarter earnings that Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst\nMark Diverio expects forest product companies to report as a\ngroup. Mr. Diverio said he expects the industry to continue\nreporting quarterly earnings declines through mid-1991 as\ncapacity increases outrun demand for several forest\ncommodities. Mr. Chao at Salomon Brothers expects just four\nU.S. forest products concerns to report earnings gains for\nthe first quarter: Temple-Inland Inc., Willamette Industries\nInc., Potlatch Corp. and Kimberly-Clark Corp.\n   J.A. Parsons, chief financial officer at Willamette, said,\n\"I think certainly the building products side will be up. The\nquestion mark is the paper side.\" He declined to make an\nearnings forecast.\n   Analysts expect almost every Canadian forest products\nconcern to report a drop in first-quarter profit, and some\nexpect one or two Canadian companies to report losses.\nSeveral Canadian companies, including Abitibi-Price, Canadian\nPacific Forest Products, Domtar Inc. and Donohue Inc., have\nalready warned shareholders that 1990 will be a difficult\nyear. \"We're living in difficult times,\" said Alain Lemaire\nat Quebec-based Cascades Inc.", "id": "\n900402-0122.", "title": "\n   Forest Products\n   Makers to Post\n   Lower Earnings\n   ---\n   Analysts Say Price Discounts\n   Threaten to Cut Profits\n   At U.S., Canadian Firms\n   ----\n   By G.

Total return measures\nprice changes and interest income. That dead performance\nreflects a sharp rise in interest rates. The yield on 30-year\nTreasury bonds, for example, rose to 8.62% last week from\n7.99% at the end of December.\n   Last year, when interest rates were falling, long-term\nTreasury bonds were the best performing sector of the bond\nmarket, which goes to show how volatile the bond market has\nbecome lately.\n   The first-quarter bond market report held some encouraging\nnews for the long-suffering junk market. Although junk bonds\nproduced a negative 2.11% total return in the quarter, they\nput in a respectable performance in March.\n   First Boston Corp., which tracks the performance of 343\njunk bonds, said that total return of junk bonds rose nearly\n3% in March following two sharp declines in January and\nFebruary.\n   The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. fueled the advance amid\nintensifying rumors that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. would\nbuy back as much as $2 billion of the company's reset\npay-in-kind debentures. On Friday, some RJR bonds advanced as\nmuch as 2 1/8 points -- about $21.25 for a bond with a $1,000\nface amount -- as a Business Week article said RJR was\nleaning toward a buy-back. People close to KKR disputed the\nreport, saying no such decision has been made.\n   RJR's junk bonds aren't the only gainers these days. First\nBoston said that three junk bonds advanced last month for\neach junk bond that declined. The advance-decline ratio\n\"shows that the rebound is broad based,\" said Robert Long, a\nFirst Boston managing director.\n   Mr. Long said junk bonds are being supported in part by\ncorporate buy-backs. \"Some companies have been buying $10\nmillion to $20 million of their bonds back. That's been\nputting more cash in the hands of (junk bond) portfolio\nmanagers, and we're starting to see that cash go to work,\"\nsaid Mr. Long. \"Our trading desk is running 2% to 3% higher\nvolume.\"\n   Still, most investors would have been better off by\navoiding bonds altogether and putting their money into cash\nand cash equivalents such as short-term Treasury bills.\nMerrill Lynch said that three-month Treasury bills produced a\ntotal first-quarter return of 1.96% while six-month bills\nproduced a 1.89% return. Cash levels help to protect\nportfolios during down markets.\n   Despite the first quarter's dismal performance, some money\nmanagers remain optimistic about the remainder of the year.\n   \"Our view is that this is a correction in a bull market\"\nfor bonds, said Roger Early, a portfolio manager at Federated\nInvestors Corp. Mr. Early says that the economy is growing\nvery slowly, corporate profits have been poor and corporate\nborrowing is dwindling.

The issue's\nyield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price,\nrose to 8.62% from 8.58%.\n   The bond market started the session on solid ground after\nprices got a modest boost from buying in Europe. But the\nmarket quickly switched directions, with 30-year bond prices\nfalling a full point immediately after news that the\nPurchasing Management Association of Chicago had seen its\nindex of area business activity rise to 55.1% on an\nunadjusted basis in March from an unrevised 51.0% in\nFebruary.\n   The increase in the Chicago index was greater than had\nbeen expected. It raised concerns that the March survey of\npurchasing agents nationwide, due out today, would show a\nsimilar acceleration in business activity.\n   In the corporate market, the high-yield junk bonds of RJR\nNabisco continued to surge. The bonds were up all week on\nrumors that KKR would buy back a portion of the reset notes.\nOfficials at RJR have consistently declined to comment on the\nrumors.\n   RJR's 13.71% convertible pay-in-kind debentures maturing\nin 2009 gained 2 1/8 to finish at 74 3/4 in moderate volume\non the New York Stock Exchange.

The highest yield they can\nexpect: about 9% at some banks in a few especially\ncompetitive markets, mostly in New England.\n   \"The bloom is off the rose,\" says Robert K. Heady,\npublisher of Bank Rate Monitor newsletter.\n   Interest rates in general are more than a percentage point\nlower than they were a year ago. And with a softer economy in\nsome parts of the country tempering loan demand, many banks\nhave less need to go out of their way to attract deposits.\nThe government bailout of the troubled thrift industry has\nalso helped reduce aggressive competition, by eliminating a\nnumber of institutions using extra-high yields to attract\ndesperately needed funds.\n   All that might be considered good news for the stock\nmarket. After all, yields on one-year CDs are generally\naround 8%, two full percentage points below the historical\nreturn on stocks, which has averaged 10% annually over the\npast 63 years.\n   Typically, however, investors are very conservative with\nthe money they put into CDs. Most of them simply roll over\nmaturing certificates into new ones of the same maturity.\nThis month will probably be no exception.\n   \"Customers are more wary of the stock market right now and\nare looking for safety,\" says Anne Nelson, senior vice\npresident of CoreStates Financial Corp. in Philadelphia.\n   Cautious CD investors do have some alternatives, however.\nTreasury bills and money-market mutual funds both offer\nyields higher than the average CD. Six-month T-bills were\nyielding 8.22% last week, and the interest is exempt from\nstate and local income taxes. (T-bills, however, require a\nminimum investment of $10,000.) The average seven-day\ncompound yield on money funds is 7.98%, and some funds are\nyielding more than 8.5%.\n   CD yields are actually up a bit from earlier this year. In\npart, that reflects a slight rise in the general level of\ninterest rates. Some institutions have also increased rates\nin recent weeks to beat the competition, says Norberto Mehl,\nchairman of Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information\nservice. \"It's a classic picture in March and April,\" he\nsays.\n   April is a big CD month for several reasons, such as tax\ndeadlines and investments in individual retirement accounts.\nAlso, some of the cash that fled the stock market after the\nOctober 1987 crash moved into six-month CDs, which, along\nwith one-year CDs, are the most popular maturities among\nindividual investors. That interest rates reached five-year\nhighs last April only added to the horde of cash becoming\navailable for reinvestment this month.\n   Some banks and thrifts are trying to smooth out the\ndeposit inflows with odd-term CDs. New York's Bowery Savings\nof America, for example, is offering four-month and\nnine-month CDs with an 8.33% yield that could go up if\ninterest rates rise.\n   Promotions on more popular maturities vary. In New York,\nBank of New York is advertising a six-month CD \"that can only\ngo in one direction.\" Its yield, currently 7.78%, is\nguaranteed to rise with any increase in the benchmark prime\nlending rate. In the Washington, D.C., area, Perpetual\nSavings Bank permits one withdrawal during the term of its\none-year CD without the usual penalty. Investors can also add\nfunds during the year.\n   Provident Savings Bank in Cincinnati advertises \"Cash\nBonus CDs\" that \"pay cash plus high yields.\" Bonuses range\nfrom $50, for a $5,000 two-year deposit, to $2,500, for\n$100,000 deposited for five years. The important thing for\ninvestors is comparing yields. \"The consumer-investor has to\nlook (at what the banks) offer . . . and see what he's really\ngetting,\" says Mr. Heady of Bank Rate Monitor.\n   Bank of New York's six-month CD, for instance, is just a\ntiny bit higher than the national average of 7.72% and\nslightly below the New York average of 7.81%. Provident's\nadvertised yields include the cash bonuses.\n   Long-term CD yields are relatively more attractive than\nthey've been in the recent past, which may encourage some\ndepositors to trade in their six-month and one-year CDs. In\nSan Francisco, for instance, both Wells Fargo Bank and Bank\nof America are offering 8.44% on five-year CDs, compared with\n7.90% for six months. A year ago, yields peaked at the\none-year or two-year maturities. Last October, another big CD\nrollover month, yields were relatively flat across the board,\nat around 8%.\n   Investors looking for higher-than-average CD yields may\nwant to check with major brokerage firms, which negotiate\nrates with the banks and thrifts whose CDs they sell. At\nMerrill Lynch & Co., for instance, an investor can get a\none-year CD yielding 8.25% or slightly more. The average\none-year broker-sold CD is currently yielding 8.14%. That\ncompares with an average of 7.91% at major banks surveyed by\nBanxquote Money Markets.\n   For the very highest yields, investors will have to seek\nout individual banks offering special rates, because of local\nfactors. For instance, several banks in Boston, Providence,\nR.I., and some other New England cities are offering one-year\nCDs with 9% yields. \"The whole outlook on banking is negative\nin this area,\" says Edward D. McCarthy, a Providence\nfinancial planner. \"The negative psychology really works to\nthe saver's advantage.\"", "id": "\n900402-0170.", "title": "\n   Your Money Matters:\n   April's CD Buyers Face Lukewarm Yields\n   ----\n   By Georgette Jasen\n   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal"}, "doc\n900402-0053.": {"content": "\n   The Libyan government blamed the West, especially West\nGermany, for the blaze, and reported casualties and arrests\nin the incident, while maintaining its posture that the Rabta\nfacility makes pharmaceuticals, not chemical weapons.\n   But as intelligence officials analyzed more evidence, the\ncircumstances of the incident have become vaguer instead of\nclearer, Bush administration officials said, raising\nsuspicions that the plant may not have suffered much or any\ndamage.\n   Asked whether the fire might have been a Libyan hoax to\ntrip up a U.S. campaign to get the plant dismantled, State\nDepartment spokesman Richard Boucher said, \"I can't rule that\nout.\" One U.S. official said the administration was actively\nconsidering the possibility that the whole event was staged.\nHe said intelligence analysts are studying a claim made by a\nLibyan exile group that the fire was set using old tires and\nother debris as fuel.", "id": "\n900402-0053.", "title": "\n   Hoax Is Suspected in Fire\n   Reported at Libyan Plant"}, "doc\n900402-0195.": {"content": "", "id": "\n900402-0195.", "title": "\n   Who's News:\n   Timken Co."}, "doc\n900402-0074.": {"content": "\n   One of Japan's most significant reform proposals, say\nJapanese officials, will likely be an overhaul of the\nlarge-scale retail-store law, which protects politically\ninfluential mom-and-pop storeowners but blocks many big\nstores from opening.\n   Toshio Yamaguchi, the head of the ruling Liberal\nDemocratic Party committee drafting Japan's strategy for the\nbilateral structural talks, said in a Japanese television\ninterview Sunday that government leaders were considering\nendorsing repeal of the law in large cities.\n   The U.S. says the law is unfair because new Japanese\nstores can open branches in America almost immediately, but\nnew stores in Japan can be forced to wait as long as 10\nyears. U.S. negotiators also say large stores, even\nJapanese-owned, are more likely to carry imported goods.\n   Mr. Yamaguchi also said Japan would probably respond to\nU.S. demands for increased public spending by publicizing how\nmuch it is planning to spend on various projects already\nbudgeted, such as sewerage systems and public parks. The U.S.\nwants Japan to spend more, because macroeconomic theory\nsuggests Japan's unusually high savings rate contributes to\nits huge trade surplus, and increased public spending would\nreduce national savings.\n   Other Japanese government officials said a third major\ngovernment proposal would be to revise the anti-monopoly law\nby, among other things, increasing the monetary penalty for\nviolations.

A final report is\nscheduled for completion by July.\n   Although most of the attention has focused on Japan, the\nU.S. is also supposed to propose changes in its economic\nstructure, including measures to encourage increased savings\nand investment.\n   Japan was the main subject of the National Trade Estimates\nreport released Friday by the White House trade\nrepresentative's office. The report will be the basis for the\nBush administration's decision -- expected at the end of\nApril -- on which countries to target under the tough Super\n301 provision of its 1988 trade act. The Super 301 provision\nrequires the administration to identify and try to resolve\nparticularly egregious trade barriers, with the threat of\ntrade retaliation if those talks are unsuccessful.\n   The U.S. is particularly anxious to ensure that its\nhi-technology industries aren't hurt by foreign trade\npractices. Thus, last year, Japan's satellite and\nsupercomputer trade practices were targeted under Super 301.\nThis year, the National Trade Estimates adds amorphous metals\nto its list of complaints against Japan, alleging that the\nU.S. patent holder, Allied-Signal Inc., has been unable to\nlicense production in Japan \"despite years of effort.\"\n   Late Friday, the two countries agreed on a\ntelecommunications accord, just before a Saturday deadline\nthat could have been the signal for U.S. trade retaliation.\nThe accord involves network channel terminating equipment.\n   Network channel terminating equipment are modem-like\ndevices used to connect computers to digital communications\nnetworks.

After all, the nomination was\nintended to fix a problem they had caused in trying to\ninstall M. Danny Wall in the post. A federal court ruled that\nMr. Wall had been appointed unconstitutionally, and that the\nwork of the OTS is therefore null and void. While this ruling\nhas been temporarily stayed, the only sure fix is a new\nnominee properly nominated and approved.\n   Then too, five Senators, including Banking Committee\nChairman Don Riegle, are in political hot water for leaning\non regulators to go easy on Lincoln Savings & Loan. In\naddition to hanging uninsured paper on widows, Lincoln's\nCharles Keating had showered PAC contributions on Senators.\nHe showed up at the hearings to oppose Mr. Ryan as lacking\nexperience in the ways of the thrift world. For that matter,\nthe Senators and their House colleagues pretty much caused\nthe thrift crisis with legislation, notably the expansion of\ndeposit insurance to $100,000 an account, designed to reward\ntheir thrift contributors and their allies, real-estate\nmagnates in every Congressional District.\n   But no, it seems that some members of The World's Greatest\nDeliberative Body are immune to the least flicker of shame.\nThe likes of Chairman Riegel and Senator Alan Cranston\nassaulted Mr. Ryan for lack of experience and for some\nremotely imagined conflict of interest (as best we can make\nout, hiring the same person in private life he'd earlier\nhired in government). When the committee took its vote on Mr.\nRyan Friday, two Democrats joined the panel's nine\nRepublicans to squeak the nominee through, 11 to 10. Within\nhours, someone leaked to NBC the fact that Mr. Ryan, 44, had\nincluded in his FBI report an admission of some drug use when\nhe was in law school, and some pious Democratic Senators were\nquick to start discussing an end to the nomination. Well,\nit's spring and the traditional Beltway slime is oozing\nagain.\n   We ourselves have little idea what Mr. Ryan may do in the\noffice, but we're willing to take our chances with anyone of\nsome independence. The objecting Senators' real problem is\nprecisely Mr. Ryan's independence, in particular his\nstatement that he had no opinion on whether the thrift\nindustry ought to be preserved; acting director Salvatore\nMartoche has no more experience in thrifts, but was warmly\nreceived in Congress after taking the pledge to make sure a\nthrift industry survives.\n   In fact, in the current financial environment there is no\npublic-policy justification whatever for a separate and\ndistinct Savings and Loan industry. The good thrifts should\nbecome banks, or perhaps in some cases financial firms\nwithout deposit insurance. The rest should be put out of\ntheir misery with the least damage to anyone else. It is\nprecisely because the thrifts' protectors in Congress know\nthis to be true that they make an issue of the point. In\nshort, Congress got us into this mess by showering\npreferences on a narrow industry with deep pockets for\ncontributions. In their reception of Mr. Ryan, many of the\nsame Senators are back at the same old stand.\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Franklin and Other Blunders\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Officials of the Resolution Trust Corp., another head of\nthe hydra that runs the thrift bailout, meet today with Wall\nStreet types over the turmoil in the mortgage-backed bond\nmarket caused by the seizure of Franklin Savings & Loan of\nOttawa, Kansas. No one had doubted that Franklin could meet\nits interest payments on bonds it had issued, but the\ngovernment seized it anyway and is now threatening to default\non its interest payments. This is how regulators stabilize\nour financial system.\n   While there's no reason to question the integrity or\nsophistication of Franklin's management, we can understand\nwhy regulators might look cross-eyed. Recognizing that making\nreal-estate loans was not a particularly good use of thrift\nresources, Franklin's Ernest Fleischer decided instead to\ninvest in mortgage-backed bonds, then to hedge against\ninterest-rate movements. This left an apparently guaranteed\nreturn, and allowed him to garner enough insured deposits to\nballoon the prairie thrift into an $11 billion institution.\nBut by second-guessing the concern's auditors on when hedge\nlosses need to be recognized, regulators toppled the empire,\neven though it had assets to meet its liabilities.\n   The Franklin hedge operation is best understood as a way\nto distill out the financial essence of the insurance on\nthrift deposits. Deposit insurance lowered the cost of\nliabilities without affecting the return on assets; with\nsecurities instead of real estate, and with interest rates\nhedged, nothing was left but the spread (and, we learn, an\nunhedgeable regulatory risk). Very neat, but what public\npurpose does it serve to deserve the potential taxpayer\nliability implicit in insurance?\n   In defense of Mr. Fleischer, he didn't make up the rules.\nAnd investing insured deposits in a diversified portfolio of\nmortgage-backed bonds serves at least as much public purpose\nas investing them in unneeded shopping centers or office\nbuildings. Ultimately the question Franklin raises is whether\nwe need any subsidized thrift industry, but its structure\nalso boiled this issue down into its purest essence. This is\npresumably why regulators were uncomfortable.\n   Franklin was a solvent institution, not likely to go\nbelly-up soon, at least on the basis of anything public so\nfar. The problem is simply that there's no reason for\ntaxpayers to subsidize a hedging operation. The textbook\nsolution would be to phase down deposit insurance, and\ntherefore Franklin's spreads. The old-time solution would be\nfor regulators to take Mr. Fleischer for a walk in the wheat\nfields, and tell him to unwind his positions and retire to\nPalm Springs. After all, he is the single most qualified\nperson to undo the positions with minimum disruption.\n   Instead, the regulators decided to tank Franklin and its\n$11 billion in assets. Then they started making noises about\nprovisions in Congress's bailout masterpiece that might be\ninterpreted to say that after a thrift is seized, the\ngovernment can suspend interest payments on liabilities even\nif they are backed with the collateral of firm assets.\nStandard and Poor's noticed and reviewed the rating of the\nbonds. The markets reacted in shock, and the regulators\nretired to scratch their heads. Pending lawsuits, they may\nfor better or worse destroy the hedge operation, but they\nhave chosen the course of maximum disruption, maximum cost to\nthe taxpayer, and maximum risk to the financial system.\n   Franklin is a dramatic example, but unhappily does not\nseem to be an isolated one. Regulators, for example, are\ntearing up contracts with people who bought sick thrifts at\ntheir urging the last time around. Aside from the legal\nproblems this raises and the attendant financial\nuncertainties, there is the simple business point. The\nregulators' chief task is to dispose of the portfolios they\nare seizing; if they welch on their last agreements, who will\ndeal with them now? They are already coming back to taxpayers\nfor more money to carry assets they have been unwilling or\nunable to sell.\n                                                                                                       \n\n   Minding the Store\n                                                                                                       \n\n   If we are not to keep sinking deeper in the mire, someone\nis going to have to take charge.

It has propelled the administration into high\ngear to push for his approval in a full Senate vote, which\ncould occur Wednesday.\n   Mr. Ryan disclosed the information to the Federal Bureau\nof Investigation during its background check, and the Senate\nBanking Committee had that information before voting and\nbefore NBC News reported it Friday evening. \"Prior to my\nnomination, I disclosed both on my FBI forms and verbally to\nthe White House and Treasury and the FBI that early in the\n1970s, I smoked marijuana on a few occasions and tried\ncocaine once, perhaps twice,\" said his statement after the\nNBC report. \"I regret this mistake. I don't regret having\nvoluntarily disclosed this information.\"\n   Treasury officials said Secretary Nicholas Brady\ntelephoned senators over the weekend to push for Mr. Ryan's\nnomination. He had telephoned and visited many members of the\ncommittee the morning of the panel's vote, as well. \"We knew\nabout this issue because the nominee voluntarily disclosed\nthe information,\" Mr. Brady said. \"We do not believe the\nreported incident should deter the full Senate from acting\npromptly and favorably on Mr. Ryan's nomination.\"\n   Some Republicans agreed that such a long-ago and\nshort-lived brush with drugs shouldn't tarnish Mr. Ryan's\nchances. \"There's a whole generation that's coming up for\nposts in this kind of circumstance,\" said Sen. John Warner\n(R., Va.), who sponsored Mr. Ryan in the Banking Committee.\n\"We can't write off those persons who many years ago have\nexperimented with controlled substances.\"\n   Some in the Senate said that negative votes on Mr. Ryan\nwould be more likely to stem from general dissatisfaction\nwith the rocky progress of the bailout law passed last August\nthan from the drug issue. Republican leaders, including\nKansas Sen. Robert Dole, have warned that the thrift crisis\ncould haunt the party in elections.\n   Even those who supported him said it was better to have\nsomeone in the post with little financial background than no\none at all. \"He might not have been my choice,\" said Sen.\nPhil Gramm (R., Texas). \"But there's not a hell of a lot of\npeople lined up for this job.\"\n   Mr. Ryan, a former Labor Department lawyer, received\nunanimous endorsement Friday from the committee's\nRepublicans.

An aide said the\nsenator always had intended to support Mr. Ryan.\n   He won the nomination despite protests from Sen. Howard\nMetzenbaum (D., Ohio), who said that Mr. Ryan skirted ethics\nrequirements in several instances, such as when he served on\nan advisory council to the Employee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act at the same time he represented a business group\nwith interests in the issue. Mr. Ryan subsequently resigned\nfrom the council, at the request of the Labor Department.\n   The committee vote Friday was a blow to Sen.

For these patients, \"the amount of\nbinding to transferrin is less than half the normal amount,\"\nsaid Dr. Altmann.

These firms,\nincluding commercial banks and savings and loans, raised just\n$13.5 billion in the first quarter, down nearly 50% from\nyear-earlier levels. This helped pull down the volume of\nconventional debt offerings underwritten by Merrill to $6.5\nbillion from $9.8 billion a year ago.\n   Merrill officials say many corporate issuers are sitting\ntight, waiting for clues to the direction of interest rates.\nAnd Merrill contends that it's difficult to draw conclusions\nfrom just one quarter.\n   \"It's a little bit like talking to the coach at the end of\nthe first quarter in a basketball game,\" says Edson Mitchell,\na Merrill managing director.\n   Despite its slip, Merrill continues to lead in most\nsectors of the debt market.

They shape\nmetal parts as diverse as refrigerator doors and industrial\nbearings.\n   Since mid-1989, uncertainty about the economic outlook has\ncaused many durable-goods makers to hold back on buying\nmachine tools. Auto and truck companies, auto-parts producers\nand defense contractors, all major machine tool users, have\nslashed orders, as have some small machine shops. There are\nexceptions, such as producers of commercial aircraft, who are\nordering briskly.\n   However, in the eight months ended Feb. 28, orders placed\nwith U.S. machine-tool plants dropped 25% from the\nyear-earlier period, according to NMTBA-Association for\nManufacturing Technology, a McLean, Va., trade group.\n   Shipments held up well through the end of last year, but\nthe backlog of unshipped orders is dwindling, forcing\nproduction cutbacks.\n   Based on current production schedules, Cincinnati Milacron\nInc., the nation's largest machine-tool producer, expects\nmuch lower profits for the first quarter. The second quarter\nwill be better than the first, the company says, but probably\nwill be below a year earlier. Besides the lower orders,\nMilacron's first quarter will reflect some continued costs of\na restructuring of production.\n   Milacron had profit from operations of 23 cents a share in\nthe 1989 first quarter and 16 cents a share in the second.\nTax credits brought net income for the first quarter to $10\nmillion, or 41 cents a share, and for the second quarter to\n$5.2 million, or 21 cents a share.\n   Ronald Petrie, machinery analyst with McDonald & Co.,\nCleveland, expects relatively weak machine-tool profits for\nthe first and second quarters. However, he's forecasting an\nupturn in manufacturing by midyear that will spark\nmachine-tool sales and result in higher profits for the\nsecond half.\n   Mr. Petrie figures Milacron will earn $1 a share for the\nyear, in spite of a slow start. A Milacron spokesman\nindicates that may be a bit optimistic, but the company also\nis expecting an improved second half. For 1989, profit from\ncontinuing operations was $18.4 million, or 75 cents a share,\nand net income, after tax credits and losses on a\ndiscontinued business, was $17.4 million, or 70 cents a\nshare.\n   Mr. Petrie expects Cross & Trecker Corp., Bloomfield\nHills, Mich., to break even for the year ending Sept. 30,\ncompared with a fiscal 1989 loss from operations of $15.3\nmillion and a net loss of $46.5 million, or $3.76 a share,\nincluding restructuring charges. Company officials have\nforecast a return to profitability during the year, but\ndeclined to say whether profits late in the year will balance\noff losses in early months.\n   However, intense import competition also is curbing\nprofits for U.S. machine-tool builders. Machine-tool imports\nlast year rose 17% to a record $2.4 billion, NMTBA said.\nImports supplied about half the new machine tools purchased\nby U.S. factories last year. And transplant factories owned\nby Japanese concerns are a growing part of U.S. production.\n   Exports are a bright spot for U.S. machine-tool builders.\nU.S. machine-tool exports in 1989 totaled $949.8 million, up\n24% from a year earlier, NMTBA said. However, even those\nmarkets are threatened. The declining value of the Japanese\nyen against the dollar makes Japanese machine tools even\ntougher competitors in Canada, Mexico, Europe and the Pacific\nRim, all areas where U.S. machine-tool exports have been\ngrowing.\n   U.S. machine-tool builders say Eastern Europe and the\nSoviet Union are promising long-term markets, as those\ncountries attempt to modernize inefficient factories.\nHowever, 1990 sales in that region aren't likely to be large\nenough to affect the bottom line.\n   Nonetheless, some of the specialized machine-tool\ncompanies, especially those that do a large business in\nWestern Europe, are likely to report higher profits for the\nfirst quarter and full year. European companies have been\ninvesting heavily in new equipment in recent months.\n   Hurco Cos., Indianapolis, reported net for the first\nquarter ended Jan. 31 of $2.2 million, or 38 cents a share,\non revenue of $22.7 million, up from year-earlier net of $1.3\nmillion, or 28 cents a share, on revenue of $18.4 million.\n   Hurco specializes in small milling machines and machining\ncenters equipped with electronic controls. About half of this\nyear's sales will be overseas, says Michael K. Campbell, vice\npresident, finance and chief financial officer.\n   Mr. Campbell says Hurco's earnings for the fiscal second\nquarter will exceed the year-earlier's 40 cents a share, and\nhe has no quarrel with an estimate by McDonald & Co.'s Mr.\nPetrie that net for the year ending Oct. 31 will rise to\n$2.10 a share from $1.70 a share in fiscal 1989.\n   Some analysts also forecast higher profits for Brown &\nSharpe Manufacturing Co., North Kingstown, R.I., which makes\nmeasuring machines used with automated-manufacturing\nequipment.\n   Giddings & Lewis Inc., Fond du Lac, Wis., specialist in\ncomputer-directed manufacturing cells and systems, is likely\nto report higher profits for the first quarter and year, says\nF. John Mirek, machinery analyst for Blunt Ellis & Loewi,\nMilwaukee. \"They started the year with a strong backlog of\norders that are priced higher than the backlog of a year\nago,\" says Mr. Mirek. He's estimating first quarter net at 40\ncents a share, up from 31 cents a year earlier, and profit\nfor the year of $1.80 a share, compared with 1989 net of\n$17.1 million, or $1.65 a share.

The scientists, engineers and\nprogrammers who use workstations demand fast machines to run\ncomplex software and display detailed graphics.\n   Digital has had a hard time in the market for fast\nworkstations that use reduced-instruction-set-computing, or\nRISC, architecture and the UNIX operating system. Most of\nDigital's workstation sales are VAXstations that run its\nproprietary operating system.\n   Mr. Gaubatz of Digital said that Digital's new\nworkstations will be based on Mips Computer Systems Inc.'s\nR-3000 microprocessor. He said that Digital engineers have\ncoaxed performance of 24 million instructions per second, or\nMIPS, an industry measure of performance. That far outspeeds\nDigital's Decstation 2100 workstation, which processes 14\nMIPS. But it falls short of IBM's new Powerstation 320, which\nruns at 27 MIPS, and its more expensive Powerstation 530,\nwhich runs at 34.5 MIPS.\n   Analysts generally expect Digital to price its newest\nmodel at less than $20,000, depending on features. Mr.\nGaubatz said the workstation will be competitively priced.\n   Marc Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities, said that\nhe thinks Digital's new workstation will run faster than\nIBM's workstations in commercial applications, although it\nwill be slower for many scientific jobs involving heavy\ncomputation.\n   Digital entered the RISC-workstation market early last\nyear, breaking with tradition by buying a microprocessor\ndesign from another company, Mips Computer, rather than\nbuilding its own design. Digital's goal was to get into the\nmarket fast. However, analysts say that its entries, the\nDECstation family, have gotten off to a slow start. Terry\nShannon, who follows Digital for International Data Corp.,\nFramingham, Mass., estimates that Digital sold only about\n6,000 of the DECstations last year compared with about 60,000\nVAXstations.\n   Domenic J. LaCava, Digital's vice president in charge of\nworkstations, noted that the DECstation sales are \"all\nincremental business,\" that otherwise would have gone to UNIX\ncompetitors such as Sun Microsystems. But Digital's version\nof UNIX is sufficiently different from others that many UNIX\nprograms have yet to be translated, or \"ported\" in industry\njargon, to the DECstations. Digital is pushing developers to\nport their software.\n   Mr. Gaubatz of Digital said that, \"the first year was a\nsignal that Digital was serious about the UNIX market. The\nfeatures in the new product make up for all the shortfalls of\nthe current model.\"", "id": "\n900402-0173.", "title": "\n   Technology & Health:\n   DEC Poised\n   To Introduce\n   Workstation\n   ---\n   Firm Touts Product's Size\n   And Quality of Graphics;\n   Speed Surpassed by IBM\n   ----\n   By William M.

The\nU.S. currency met little resistance as it jumped to 160.25\nyen late Monday morning, up from 158.35 yen late Friday in\nNew York.\n   That sent the stock market tumbling. Its slide also was\ngreased by fears that Japanese insurance companies would\nbegin selling stock at the start of their new fiscal year\nthis morning. A report in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's\nleading economic daily, suggesting that life and casualty\ninsurers -- among the country's biggest institutional\ninvestors -- would reduce their Japanese stock holdings\nappeared to be coming true, one stockbroker said Monday\nmorning. \"They are selling already,\" she added.\n   The report magnified the market's troubles on Friday, when\nfast-paced sell-offs by institutions trying to raise their\ncash positions by the end of the fiscal year compounded\nuncertainty about the market's direction.\n   On Friday, the indicator plunged 1045.71 points, or 3.4%,\nto 29980.45, closing below the 30000-point level for the\nsecond time in March. On March 22, the index dropped to\n29843.34.

Meanwhile, the pace of decline in stock prices was\naccelerated by index-linked program selling by foreign\nbrokerate houses, traders said.\n   The Nikkei index, which ended the Friday morning session\nwith an 850.15-point loss, rebounded moderately in\nmidafternoon with the help of buying by some investment trust\nfunds. But the index tumbled again, to the intraday low of\n29827, in final rounds of sell-offs, before the average\ncollected 150 points in the last 15 minutes of trading.\n   Volume on the first section was estimated at about 500\nmillion shares, down from 685 million shares Thursday.\n   Losers outnumbered gainers 866 to 133, while 93 issues\nwere unchanged.\n   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the\nfirst section was down 59.37 points, or 2.59%, to 2227.48,\nafter falling 20 points Thursday.\n   The second section index fell 37.45 points, or 0.97%, to\n3817.90. The index gained 11.10 points Thursday. Volume was\nestimated at nine million shares, down from 10 million shares\nThursday.\n   The market had seen small-capital stock prices pushed up\nby \"window dressing\" operations by some institutions, which\nevaluate year-end values of their holdings according to\nFriday's close. These stock prices had been expected to add\nfurther gains Friday.\n   But such expectations were shattered when the market began\nthe day with active selling by foreign investors. The strong\nselling pressure made institutions give up strategic buying\nand begin reducing their positions instead, analysts said.\n   Dealers also refrained from buying Friday.\n   \"Every Japanese brokerage house couldn't do anything\nbeyond remain on the sidelines because they knew that if they\nbought, they'd only be battered by heavy selling,\" said\nYoshihiro Ito, general manager of stock trading at Okasan\nSecurities.\n   As the Nikkei index extended losses during Friday\nafternoon, individual investors finally joined the selling\nactivity, as prices fell to levels that require investors to\nplace additional margin, the official said.\n   Shin Tokoi, deputy general manager of stock trading at\nCounty NatWest Securities, said market expectations that the\nyen will weaken further and top the 160-yen level against the\ndollar was strong, despite the yen's temporal recovery in the\nmiddle of the day.\n   The heavy selling by foreign investors and the continually\nweakening yen led some investors to blame Japanese politics,\nwhich are often poorly appraised by foreign nations.\n   Traders predict stock prices will drift at low levels this\nweek.\n   \"The market has no strength for a strong rebound at the\nmoment,\" one analyst said, adding that the Nikkei index will\nfluctuate around the 30000-point level this week.\n   High-technology shares, which advanced strongly this past\nweek on expectations that these exporters will benefit from\nthe yen's weakness, were targets of active profit-taking\nFriday.\n   Fanuc plummeted 320 yen to 7,450 yen ($2.05 to $47.62).\nKyocera fell 210 yen to 7,560 yen.

That system is the grossest\nmanifestation of South Africa's zealous effort -- known as\ngrand apartheid -- to separate white from black.\n   South Africa's political analysts call it a \"revolution of\nraised expectations.\" The political reforms, coming after\nyears of repression, have prompted black demands for an\novernight cleansing of the poisons of apartheid. Every day\nbrings new protests across the country. Teachers demonstrate\nagainst the inferior black education system, township\nresidents march against high rents and community squalor,\nprison warders strike over poor treatment and segregation in\nthe prison administration.\n   The result has been a wave of unrest that threatens the\nwhite government's efforts to begin power-sharing\nnegotiations with the black majority. Last week, police\nopened fire on black protesters in the township of Sebokeng,\nsouth of Johannesburg, killing nine and injuring more than\n400. A few days later, the ANC indefinitely postponed the\nopening round of talks with the government scheduled for\nApril 11.\n   The unrest has been particularly acute in the 10 black\nhomelands. In KwaZulu, more than 200 people have died in\nrecent weeks during fighting between supporters of Chief\nMangosuthu Buthelezi's homeland government and ANC-allied\ngroups opposed to the homeland system. And in the four\nhomelands granted independence by South Africa (while\nPretoria treats them as sovereign states, the rest of the\nworld refuses to recognize them), the impoverished residents\nare pushing to reincorporate the territories into South\nAfrica.\n   In Ciskei, on the Indian Ocean coast, disgruntled\nsoldiers, favoring reincorporation, led a successful coup,\nprompting several days of celebration and looting that left\ndozens dead and injured. In Bophuthatswana, homeland police\nopened fire on residents who angrily took to the streets\nafter the president said reincorporation would never happen\n\"in 100 years.\" In Venda, the recent wave of strikes and\nprotests has led President Frank Ravele to say he favors\nnegotiations on reincorporation. But his opponents say there\nis nothing to negotiate; they want Mr. Ravele and his entire\ngovernment to resign.\n   \"If Ravele doesn't make an announcement soon, there will\nbe protests until he does,\" says Phanuel Mphaphuli, the local\nrepresentative of the South African Council of Churches,\nwhich opposes homelands. Last week, Venda was rocked by three\nbomb blasts. Though no one was hurt, one damaged the\nParliament building.\n   The homelands pose a dilemma for Pretoria. President F.W.\nde Klerk has taken bold steps toward ending apartheid, but as\nlong as the homelands remain, apartheid will be alive and\nwell. The monster, in effect, has turned on its creator.\nWhile the government acknowledges that artificial geographic\nsegregation has failed, it is battling to control the tempo\nof change and doesn't want to yield to street protest by\nunceremoniously dumping its loyal homeland leaders. In future\nblack-white negotiations, Pretoria would like to have them on\nits side.\n   The idea of the homelands, conceived in the 1950s, was to\nrid South Africa of black citizens. In a madly ambitious\nscheme of social engineering, Pretoria divided the black\npopulation into 10 tribal groups and then herded them into\nseparate \"bantustans,\" each with its own government. A steady\nstream of money from white South African taxpayers would make\nsure they stayed put.\n   But the plan failed miserably in practice. Many blacks,\ndespite forced removals, continued to flock to the urban\nareas, where the white-run economy depends on their labor.\nThe homeland governments were derided as Pretoria's puppets.\nThe huge South African subsidies fostered rampant corruption.\nDespite attractive tax schemes, most businessmen stayed away,\nexcept for casino moguls and Taiwanese shoemakers. Instead of\nviable states, the territories became cesspools of poverty\nand shameful examples of the huge gap between white and black\nliving standards in South Africa.\n   Heading east on Route 524, there is no sign alerting\ntravelers that they are leaving \"white\" South Africa and\nentering Venda. But it is soon obvious. The mango trees, once\nin neat groves, now grow wild; brick farmhouses are now mud\nhuts; the feeder roads are now dirt instead of concrete; the\nroadside fruit stands are now auto repair shops.\n   Cut off from the wealth of South Africa, most of the\n500,000 Vendans rely on subsistence agriculture. The\ngovernment is a cabal of village chiefs, many of whom are\nill-educated. A couple of cabinet ministers have been\nimplicated in ritual murders. One allegedly buried a woman's\nhead in front of his house, hoping to derive some mystical\npower. Repression of political opposition -- in particular\nthe outspoken Lutheran Church -- has been brutal.\n   When Venda took its leave from South Africa in 1979,\nfollowing a dubious election in which the new government\nreceived scant support, Tshenuwani Farisani, the dean of the\nLutheran Church in Venda, agreed to preach at the\nindependence festivities provided he could choose his own\nsermon. He focused on the parable of the foolish man who\nbuilt his house on sand. Early the next morning his home was\nraided, beginning several years of repeated detention and\ntorture.\n   Today, Rev. Farisani is in the U.S., having left Venda in\n1987 to seek medical treatment. But since then, his lonely\ncry of protest has been rippling through the mango forests.\nNow, hardly a day goes by when some section of the population\nisn't protesting, be it against witchcraft or low salaries.\nPeople move around proudly wearing ANC T-shirts. Even the\npolice salute protesters with clenched fists.\n   \"We must give thanks for what is happening now even before\nwe reach the day of freedom,\" says Rev. Nevhutalu. \"Our\npeople aren't allowing themselves to be taken for granted\nanymore.\"", "id": "\n900402-0153.", "title": "\n   International:\n   A Pillar of Apartheid Begins to Crumble\n   ---\n   Calls to End South Africa's\n   Homeland Policy Grow\n   ----\n   By Roger Thurow\n   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal"}, "doc\n900402-0032.": {"content": "\n   Uniforce said it decided instead to raise the quarterly\ndividend rate and to increase its borrowing facility from $5\nmillion, to $15 million, \"in connection with its intention to\nexpand operations through the acquisition and conversion of\nexisting temporary services.\"\n   The dividend will be three cents a share, up from 2.5\ncents, and payable May 4 to stock of record April 20.\n   Through its Uniforce Temporary Services, the company\noperates a national network of offices providing temporary\noffice and light-industry workers.

It faces increased\ncompetition from another tabloid, Times Mirror Co.'s New York\nNewsday, at a time when the New York advertising market is\nthe softest in years.\n   Almost every scenario the Daily News faces is a dire one,\nat least for the near future. Management has demanded major\ncost and work concessions from the unions and says it is\nprepared to publish and distribute the paper in the event of\na strike. Even so, the Daily News stands to lose significant\nadvertising and circulation.\n   Union leaders say they hope to avoid a strike, yet several\nof the unions have voted strike authorizations. Many workers\nface the loss of their jobs permanently if they do walk off\ntheir jobs. If there is a strike, the unions threaten to lead\na boycott of the paper by readers and advertisers.\n   The 1980s nearly ruined the Daily News and strained\nTribune Co.'s commitment to publishing in New York. The Daily\nNews had revenue of $420 million in 1989, yet the paper was\nonly marginally profitable. Over the past decade, the paper\nhas lost $115 million on $4 billion in revenue. Average daily\npaid circulation has fallen by 400,000 copies since 1979; as\nof Sept. 30, 1989, the paper's circulation was 1.2 million,\ndown 7% from 1988.\n   The union is charging mismanagement, and claims the\nTribune intends to win concessions, then sell off the\nnewspaper. James Hoge, publisher of the Daily News, is \"a\nsociable guy, but as a publisher he's a 4 on a scale of 1 to\n10,\" said George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing\nTrades Council. \"The News has bum management.\"\n   Daily News executives blame the heavy financial burden of\na bloated union work force. About 50% of the paper's revenue\ngoes to cover employee compensation, compared with 25% to 30%\nat most other major metropolitan papers.\n   As for selling the paper, media analysts doubt it will\ntake place. \"New York is the biggest media market in the U.S.\nThe Tribune won't give that up,\" said Peter Appert, analyst\nat C.J.

But the company\nhas maintained that much of the cost-cutting measures taken\nlate last year won't bolster results until later this year.\n\"We've said all along that our restructuring will be felt in\nthe second half,\" a company spokesman said.\n   Last August, after six-month net income slid 60%, Kodak\nannounced its fourth restructuring plan since 1983. Under the\nlatest plan, the company said it would divest itself of 20\nbusinesses and eliminate about 5,000 jobs in the U.S. to\ngenerate as much as $1 billion in cash flow this year.\n   So far, the company has divested itself of its minilab\nproducts and overhead projector business and closed its\nprofessional videotape businesses, among others. The company\ntwo weeks ago also sold its floppy disk unit, the largest\nbusiness yet to be sold under its restructuring effort.\nAnalysts estimate the unit was sold for about $200 million,\nfor an estimated pretax gain of $25 million.\n   Most of the businesses sold or closed were in the\ninformation systems group, which has been hurt by high\nadministrative costs. For 1989, the business group was barely\nprofitable, generating operating profit of $57 million before\ncharges on sales of $4.2 billion. Analysts foresee little\nimprovement in the group's business outlook this year.\n   Moreover, sectors that had been strong, such as Kodak's\nchemical group, are coming under greater pressure from the\nweak economy. Operating profit is expected to fall 25% this\nyear.\n   Adding to first-quarter woes has been the relative\nstrength of the dollar overseas, particularly in Japan.\nBesides making Kodak exports more expensive in overseas\nmarkets, the strong dollar also lowers foreign currency\nearnings.

That was last year.\nThe underwriters now predict a price of $13 to $16.\n   But even at the midpoint of $14.50, Safeway could be a\ntough sell. Its interest bill is about $400 million a year,\nthrough thick times and thin. In addition, it plans to plow\n$2.5 billion of cash into much-needed capital spending over\nthe next five years. The interest and capital outlays\ntogether will soak up slightly more cash than Safeway expects\nto generate from operations. Its debt is $3.1 billion, and\nunless KKR can persuade the public to buy more stock at some\nfuture point, its debt at the end of five years won't be a\npenny less.\n   \"Wall Street doesn't like debt, and this company is going\nto have a lot of it for quite some time,\" Mark Mandel of\nContinental Asset Management says.\n   Mr. Mandel's lack of enthusiasm has nothing to do with the\nconsiderable progress that Safeway has made since Mr. Kravis\ndonned a grocer's apron. Since the buy-out by KKR, Safeway\nhas sold inefficient supermarkets and other operations and\nremodeled or built from scratch more than 100 stores. Labor\ncosts have been cut, and warehouse and buying practices\ncomputerized. Nearly half of Safeway's 1,100 outlets are\nso-called superstores, the prospectus says, with 45,000 items\nranging from fresh lobster to cored pineapples. Profit\nmargins on specialty items, some of them prepared in what\nSafeway describes as its very own \"Chinese kitchens,\" are far\nhigher than margins on standard fare. Safeway's operating\nprofit, as a percentage of sales, climbed to 3.2% in 1989\nfrom 2.3% in 1986. Operations are so improved, the prospectus\nnotes, that \"operating profit for 1989 was higher on a $14\nbillion sales base than in 1986 on a $20 billion sales base.\"\n   But the operating profit hasn't produced much at the\nbottom line. Net income for this year is forecast at 40 cents\na share; for 1991, the estimate is 85 cents. Based on the\n1990 estimate, the stock is apt to make its debut at a price\nequal to about 36 times earnings.\n   Safeway's strategy is to spend its way to higher profit.\nIt aims, every year, to remodel no fewer than 120\nsupermarkets and to build or rebuild 35 more. In the familiar\nKKR scenario, profits will pour through an ever-widening\nspigot. Sales from new stores will add 3% to total sales\nannually. Higher sales from existing stores will bump total\nsales growth to 8% or so a year. Safeway's operating profit\nmargin -- $3.20 on every $100 of sales -- will grow to $4.20\nby 1994. Higher margins on higher sales will produce a 12%\nannual gain in cash flow. By 1994, Safeway forecasts net\nincome of at least $2.25 a share.\n   Wearing the cap of a junk bond salesman, KKR once told\ninvestors that cash flow would grow enough to service\ninterest. Newly outfitted as a stock salesman, KKR projects\nthat Safeway's earnings will justify -- down the road -- the\npurchase of shares today. Safeway has grown handily so far.\nBut investors are buying the future, not the past.\n   \"I have concerns,\" says Dana Telsey, an analyst at Baron\nAsset Fund. One concern is that Safeway is telling investors\nit expects to reap a 25% to 30% return on capital spending.\n\"Those are high numbers,\" she says. Another concern she cites\nis \"the lack of earnings.\"\n   Safeway's underwriters, in effect, are urging investors to\nignore earnings. Concentrate instead, they say, on Safeway's\ncash flow before paying interest, taxes and capital outlays.\nThis stance may be fine for a bondholder, but, as James\nGrant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, notes:\n\"That's not what you're talking about as an owner. You're\ntalking about the earnings left after you put in ice-cream\nfreezers and pay the government.\"\n   While Safeway is a good business, investors haven't\nforgotten that bonds in certain other good businesses owned\nby KKR have tanked. \"There is a strong feeling that we don't\nwant to be KKR's patsy,\" says a portfolio manager at a big\nmutual fund company who plans to forgo buying the issue. KKR\nis aware of such sentiment. This is one reason KKR isn't\nselling its own Safeway shares. But KKR's own investors are\neager to cash in, and the most likely way of doing so is by\nselling shares to the public. Down the road, if the offering\nsucceeds, KKR will be back.\n   ---\n              KKR's Supermarket Safeway Inc.\n                                                                                                       \n\n\n                                                                                                       \n\n                         1989           1988           1987\n                                                                                                       \n\n Sales              $14,324.6      $13,612.4      $18,301.3\n Operating profits      462.4          325.6          416.8\n Interest expense       382.8          401.2          576.4\n Net income (loss)        2.5           31.2         (487.7)", "id": "\n900402-0048.", "title": "\n   Heard on the Street:\n   KKR's Offering Plan to Take Safeway Public\n   Doesn't Check Out With Potential Investors\n   ----\n   By Roger Lowenstein\n   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal"}, "doc\n900402-0063.": {"content": "\n   At age 32, the former public accountant suddenly finds\nhimself manager-in-waiting of Fidelity Investments' giant\nMagellan Fund. And before taking over from the legendary\nPeter Lynch, who retires May 31 at age 46 after running\nMagellan for 13 years, Mr. Smith will have plenty of numbers\nto ponder.\n   Magellan, the nation's largest stock mutual fund, has $13\nbillion in assets, one million account holders and upwards of\n1,400 stocks. From May 31, 1977, to Feb. 28, 1990, Mr. Lynch\nguided the fund to a total return of 2,475%, compared with\n508% for the Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index, according to\nFidelity. During the 1980s, the fund's average annual return,\nincluding reinvested dividends, was 28% -- far outstripping\nthat of any other fund.\n   So imposing is Mr. Lynch's record that it's been likened\nto Babe Ruth's career home run total. And Mr. Smith, whose\npassion for statistics has made him something of a sports\ntrivia buff, must recognize that Mr. Lynch is hanging up his\nuniform at a time when the outfield fences are more distant\nthan ever: Magellan's phenomenal growth, since it was opened\nto outside investors in 1981 with just $100 million in\nassets, has made it much harder for the fund to beat the\nmarket averages by any significant margin.\n   \"I've been in the spotlight before,\" Mr. Smith says\nphilosophically, recalling the brouhaha when a rising\nFidelity star named Paul Stuka left the Fidelity OTC fund in\n1986 to start his own firm, and Mr. Smith took over the fund,\nwhich now has $700 million in assets. Mr. Smith says he plans\nto handle his new challenge the way he does his current job:\n\"I try the best I can every day.\"\n   How good is Mr. Smith's best? At Fidelity OTC, Mr. Smith's\nefforts have produced respectable results during a period\nwhen small stocks generally languished. From June 30, 1986,\nwhen he took over Fidelity OTC, through March 22 of this year\nthe fund ranks as the fifth best of 46 small-company funds,\nbeaten only by Hartwell Emerging Growth, Janus Venture, Acorn\nand Kaufmann, according to New York's Lipper Analytical\nServices. (Fidelity's advertisements tout Fidelity OTC as the\n\"No. 1 Small Company Growth Fund For 5-Year Performance,\" but\nthat includes the fund's big 1985 gain under Mr. Stuka.)\n   Mr. Smith, whose fund must ordinarily keep at least 65% of\nits assets in over-the-counter stocks, has tended to hold\nrelatively large-capitalization issues. A study done in\nOctober 1989 by Chicago's Morningstar Inc. found that\nFidelity OTC's median stock holding was a company with a\nmarket value of $878 million. Morningstar, which looked at 63\nsmall-company funds, found only three funds with a higher\nmedian market value.\n   With larger-company stocks outperforming smaller companies\nover the past few years, Mr. Smith's attraction to larger\ncompanies -- something he describes as the result of\nindividual picks, not a broad strategy -- has clearly paid\noff.\n   Since taking over the fund in mid-1986, Mr. Smith has\nmanaged a return of 36% through last Feb. 28, well ahead of\nthe 10% return for the Russell 2000, a small-company stock\nindex.\n   But while Fidelity OTC has done well for a small-company\nfund, the poor performance by smaller stocks means Mr.\nSmith's record doesn't look so hot when stacked up against\nthe big-company stocks that comprise the S&P 500, which\nreturned 50% during the same period. And with small-company\nstocks out of fashion, continuous outflows since the 1987\nstock market crash have reduced the fund to roughly half its\npeak size.\n   At Magellan, Mr. Smith will be competing against the S&P\n500 -- a benchmark Mr. Lynch managed to beat every year\nexcept 1984 and 1987.\n   Fidelity officials note similarities between Mr. Smith and\nMr. Lynch. Both rise early, work prodigious hours and seem\ndevoted to their families and religions. Both keep hundreds\nof stocks in their portfolios -- Mr. Smith has 350 in the\nFidelity OTC fund -- and talk to dozens of companies in a\ntypical week. Mr. Smith is roughly the age Mr. Lynch was when\nhe took over Magellan.\n   But there are also differences between the two. Mr. Lynch,\na master of the wry one-liner and quotable anecdote, plays\nthe media almost as deftly as the stock market. He\nco-authored last year an investing book and closely monitored\nits progress on the best-seller charts, according to\ncolleagues. Mr. Lynch's modest office in Fidelity's\nDevonshire Street headquarters in downtown Boston is normally\na chaotic sea of documents and newspapers.\n   On Friday afternoon, after two days of interviews, Mr.\nSmith confesses to being weary of talking about himself. He\nspeaks in rapid-fire, run-together sentences and looks mainly\nat his desktop when he's not checking his two computer\nscreens. Toward the end of an hourlong interview, he busily\nsorts through a stack of analyst reports that will provide\nSaturday night and Sunday homework, leaving his desk as neat\nas a pin.\n   Mr. Smith describes his investment approach as similar to\nMr. Lynch's, and he says it's too early to tell what changes\nhe might make in the fund. He notes that Fidelity OTC's\nportfolio contains several of Magellan's largest positions,\nincluding Federal National Mortgage Association, General\nElectric Co., Entergy Corp., Kemper Corp., Primerica Corp.\nand Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. That overlap will help\nease his transition, he says -- as will the availability, at\nleast initially, of two or three assistants. Like Mr. Lynch,\nMr. Smith says many of his investment ideas come from\nFidelity's 30 analysts and its other fund managers.\n   Among the Fidelity OTC holdings that Mr. Smith believes\ncontinue to present attractive buying opportunities are\nMaxtor Corp., a disc-drive supplier whose technology is\n\"cutting edge\" and whose \"earnings could explode on the\nupside\"; Nike Inc., a company that \"everyone is saying has\nmaxed out\" but that Mr. Smith sees as having potential for\nstrong international growth; SNC Group Inc., a\nMontreal-listed engineering and defense company that Mr.\nSmith considers a \"terrific turnaround\"; and Prospect Group\nInc., a leveraged buyout firm. Mr. Smith says Prospect has\nannounced plans to liquidate, and he estimates the value of\nits assets at the \"low- to mid-$20s\" a share, while the stock\ntrades at around $15.\n   Mr. Smith, whose father was a fashion designer in New\nYork's garment district, earned an accounting degree at City\nUniversity of New York's Queens College and first dabbled in\nstocks while working as a certified public accountant. His\nmaster's degree in business administration from the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania's Wharton School landed him a job\nas a securities analyst at Fidelity in 1982. Two years later,\nhe became manager of Fidelity Select Leisure Portfolio.\n   As an analyst, \"The first stock I recommended was Golden\nNugget,\" and though \"not a difficult company\" to analyze, \"it\ntook me two weeks,\" Mr. Smith recalls. By contrast, Mr. Smith\nsays, he talked or met with precisely 40 companies in the\nweek before his Magellan appointment disrupted his routine.\n\"In effect, I analyzed 40 companies,\" he says, in what he\nrefers to as \"one of those great, efficient weeks.\"\n   Mr. Smith counts Rogers Communications Inc., a\nToronto-based cable television and broadcasting company,\namong his best all-time picks. He says he recommended it to\nother Fidelity managers after visiting the company in 1985,\nat a time when many people thought it was headed for\nbankruptcy. Instead, the stock went from around $7 a share to\n$80 or $90 -- although Mr. Smith admits he bailed out after\nhe had tripled his money.\n   Among his worst picks: convertible securities of Crazy\nEddie Inc., which he bought for more than $30 and sold at\naround $13, as they headed to zero. \"I used to shop at the\nfirst Crazy Eddie\" near his New York home, Mr. Smith says. \"I\nstill believe in the concept. I just don't believe in the\ncompany.\"", "id": "\n900402-0063.", "title": "\n   Mutual Funds:\n   Will the Next Manager of Magellan\n   Fund Be a Home Run Hitter?\n   ----\n   By Christoper J. Chipello and Jonathan Clements\n   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal"}, "doc\n900402-0112.": {"content": "\n   The House vote follows a new -- and not yet\nreleased-report of the National Academy of Sciences that\nurges additional government support for child care and\nrecommends a tightening of the standards regulating the\nnumber of children served by each day-care worker. This\nrecommendation may be justified, but should be evaluated in\nlight of the fundamentals of child care economics.\n   Discussions of child care need to consider two\ncontradictory issues: the high cost of child care and the low\npay of childcare workers, whose hourly earnings are the\nlowest of any major occupation. They earn 30% to 60% less per\nhour than women who serve children as kindergarten or\nelementary school teachers. Even more startling, when\nchild-care workers are compared with other women workers at\nthe same levels of education, the differential in hourly\nearnings is more than 40%.\n   Why do child-care workers earn so little? Their wages,\nlike everyone else's, are determined by the interplay of many\nfactors which can be analyzed under the familiar categories\nof demand and supply. How much are those who buy the services\nof child-care workers willing and able to pay? What\nconsiderations lead workers to accept the low wages of child\ncare rather than seek higher paying jobs?\n   The wages that a child-care center can offer its workers\ndepend entirely on three factors: the gross revenue per\nchild, the number of children served by each worker and the\noverhead expenses. The latter include the costs of\nmanagement, rent, equipment and supplies, insurance, payroll\ntaxes and interest or return on investment. In well run\ncenters that meet health and safety standards, only about\nhalf of gross revenue is available for the wages of the\nchild-care workers. For example, if the revenue per child is\n$5,000 per year, the child/worker ratio is five and the\noverhead is 50%, the annual wage for a full-time, year-round\nworker will be $12,500. This is less than half the average\nwage of nurses or teachers.\n   Who are the child-care workers and why do they accept such\nlow wages? Current research by Mary Lydon and me throws light\non both these questions. When compared with women workers in\ngeneral, or specifically with women who are elementary school\nteachers, we find that child-care workers are more likely to\nbe married, more likely to have children and much more likely\nto have three or more children.\n   Probably because of their greater family responsibilities,\nchild-care workers stay close to home. Their average commute\ntime is much less than that of teachers or other women\nworkers. They also seem to prefer part-time work. Many of\nthem do paid work for fewer than 20 hours per week, and most\nof the others work less than full time. Generally,\noccupations that are located in residential areas and afford\nsignificant part-time opportunities pay lower wages.\n   Although their average age is the same as other women\nworkers, child-care workers are less likely than other women\nto have been at work five years previously, which also helps\nexplain their lower wages. According to the National Academy\nreport, 40% leave their jobs each year.\n   Two other differences between childcare workers and\nelementary school teachers (but not other women workers) are\nimportant. First, teachers have on average about four more\nyears of schooling. But this difference in education explains\nonly about two-fifths of the wage differential. Second,\nteachers -- at least those in the public schools -- are\nhighly unionized; child-care workers are not. But again, this\nis only a partial explanation, as evidenced by the fact that\neven non-union teachers in private elementary schools make\n20% to 25% more than child-care workers (after controlling\nfor education, experience and many other variables).\n   One striking difference between teachers and child-care\nworkers is the reward (or lack of reward) for additional\nschooling. The wages of teachers rise appreciably with each\nadditional year of education. By contrast, child-care workers\nwho are college graduates earn only slightly more than those\nwhose education ended in high school. The parents who buy\nchild-care are apparently unwilling or unable to pay more for\nworkers with additional schooling. Or, from another\nperspective, they are unwilling to see the child/worker ratio\nrise in exchange for having workers with more education. This\nis precisely the trade-off that is made in France. The French\nsystem of care for pre-schoolers is often hailed as a model\nfor the United States, partly because the child-care workers\nare as well educated and as well paid as elementary school\nteachers. The child/worker ratio, however, is double that of\nAmerican nursery schools and day-care centers.\n   Higher wages for child-care workers can be achieved in\nonly three ways. A reduction in overhead expenses would free\nfunds for workers' pay, but many of these expenses are\ndetermined by laws and regulations and there is little chance\nthat this burden will be lifted. A rise in revenue per child\nwould help, but how high can fees go? An annual charge of\n$10,000 per child would probably put child care beyond the\nreach of most families. Government subsidies could supplement\nprivate payments, but public aid is most appropriately used\nto improve services for poor children, most of whom do not\ncurrently receive even the average standard of care.\n   The third possibility, an increase in the child/worker\nratio, offers the most scope for change. Failing such a\nchange, wages are likely to stay at their extremely low\nlevels. What is the right way to go? That choice should be\nmade by parents and child-care experts, not economists. Those\ndecisions, however, cannot evade or avoid the ABCs of\nchild-care economics. To want simultaneously to hold down the\ncost of care, reduce the child/worker ratio and increase the\npay and qualifications of child-care workers is to wish for a\nworld that never was and never will be.\n   ---\n   Mr. Fuchs is a professor of economics at Stanford\nUniversity and a research associate with the National Bureau\nof Economic Research.", "id": "\n900402-0112.", "title": "\n   Economics Applies to Child Care Too\n   ----\n   By Victor R.

Debt will be reduced to about $2.3\nbillion if the sale is completed, he added.\n   The low sale price wasn't unexpected.

Dedication\nceremonies tomorrow at the interchange near Erath, La., will\ncoincide with the opening of trading.\n   The New York Merc already offers futures trading in crude\noil, heating oil, gasoline, propane and residual fuel. But on\nthe eve of the gas futures' debut, there still are some who\nobject to it. These include some smaller producers worried\nabout the impact on pricing of actions by speculators and\nother outsiders not familiar with the industry's risks.\n   But similar objections were voiced before the start of\ntrading in petroleum futures, which have since reshaped world\noil markets. Proponents of the new fuel contract predict a\nsimilar restructuring of the ways natural gas is bought and\nsold.\n   \"It will have a snowball effect on the business,\" says\nJohn E. Olson, a leading proponent of gas futures trading.\n   Mr. Olson, a Houston-based natural gas analyst for First\nBoston Corp., calls the contract an idea whose time is\noverdue. \"This will provide a transparent pricing mechanism\nfor gas and will allow arbitrage against residual fuel,\" he\nsaid.\n   Gas's main competitor, residual fuel, has drawn little\ninterest on the Nymex. But total trading in the crude oil\ncontract, which has made West Texas Intermediate something of\na household term in much of the country, routinely exceeds\nthe volume of all the oil the world actually produces.\n   Few are willing to make predictions of trading volume in\nthe untried gas futures market. Some oil futures traders\nsuggest it could eventually match that of crude oil on a BTU\nor dollar basis. They see a big potential for gas because\naround 80% of the 18.8 trillion cubic feet used last year in\nthe U.S. was sold on the spot market or through short-term\ncontracts, leaving only 20% for long-term contracts.\n   \"The gas market is huge, there is increased emphasis on\ngas because of the Clean Air Act and environmental concerns,\nand the number of players is larger than for oil,\" says Lance\nSchneier, chairman of Access Energy Corp., a leading gas\nmarketer.\n   Gas prices -- currently around $1.50 per 1,000 cubic feet\nat the well-head in Texas -- have been relatively flat for\nthe past three years even as oil prices bounced back from\ntheir 1986 collapse. But demand for gas has been growing, and\nthe renewed interest in the clean-burning fuel already may\nhave eliminated the surplus that has plagued the industry for\nseveral years.\n   Still, there are tests for gas to pass before its position\nin futures markets can be assured. Not the least is the\nindustry's \"ability to fulfill a contract with the physical\ndelivery of the commodity at a specified location at a\nspecified price\" at all times, says Nicholas Bush, president\nof the Natural Gas Supply Association.\n   Contracts will be traded for 12 consecutive months, and\ndelivery is to be made over the course of the delivery month.\nBut some others also question sellers' abilities to deliver\nduring periods such as last December's cold wave, when\npipelines were operating at maximum.\n   If oil futures are any guide, actual deliveries of gas are\nlikely to be minimal. A Nymex spokeswoman says less than 1%\nof the oil traded is actually delivered. Nevertheless, such\noperational considerations will remain a concern until gas's\nfutures system is thoroughly tested.\n   \"Gas is not like soybeans or corn,\" says Alan Anderson,\npresident of Energy Planning Inc., a gas market research\nfirm. \"We are waiting to see how well it will work\nphysically.\"\n   Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:\n                                                                                                       \n\n                          Copper\n                                                                                                       \n\n   The copper market usually slows down in April as demand\ntapers off, but it should start this month roaring.\n   On Friday, the May futures contract rose to a fresh\nlife-of-contract high of $1.227 a pound before easing\nslightly to end at $1.224, up 4.50 cents.\n   Driving prices higher were a wildcat walkout by workers at\nthe Highland Valley copper mine in British Columbia, which\nwas out for 3 1/2 months last year in a similar dispute over\nusing outside workers, and a second mine strike in Peru.\nHighland Valley annually produces 160,000 tons of\nconcentrates containing about 30% copper.\n   An injunction was expected to end the Highland Valley\nwalkout, but workers at the Tintaya mine in Peru went out on\nan indefinite strike over wages Friday, analysts said.\n   Tintaya produces just over 11% of Peru's copper. Southern\nPeru Copper Corp., whose miners and smelter workers have been\non strike since March 12, produces about 64% of that\ncountry's copper, meaning slightly more than 75% of Peru's\ncopper capacity is currently shut down. Peru is the world's\nsixth largest copper producer.\n   There were reports that workers at the Ok Tedi mine in\nPapua New Guinea had gone out on strike, but they couldn't be\nconfirmed, analysts said. The mine produces 230,000 tons of\nconcentrates. Papua New Guinea is also the site of the\nBougainville copper mine, with a capacity of about 600,000\ntons of concentrates annually, which has been idled since\nlast May because of attacks by native landowners.\n   Supplies may shrink even further.

Bad debt is economic\nwaste, and thus a drag on the world economy. Such waste feeds\ninflation and inhibits economic growth. Use of tax money by\nWestern governments to finance the Soviets also makes little\nsense. By raising tax burdens, that too would slow productive\ngrowth.\n   In short, the Soviets, always a military threat, now are\nbecoming an economic threat as well. A nation stretching\naround nearly half of the northern part of the globe is\nsinking into an economic abyss. Its 280 million people are\nnot producing enough to provide themselves with adequate\nnecessities, let alone contribute anything to the world's\nsupply of capital and wealth. Rising discontent further\ndiminishes productivity.\n   Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Leonid Abalkin said last week\nthat there is no sign of an easing of the decline in energy\nand industrial output caused by strikes and political\nturmoil. In the first two months of this year, oil production\nwas off 4% from a year earlier and coal production off 6%.\nEarlier it had been reported that man-days lost to strikes\nand conflicts rose to 9.1 in the first two months from 7.3 a\nyear before. It is not entirely clear what that statistic\nmeans but it seems to indicate that the U.S.S.R. lost some\n20% to 25% of its labor capacity, obviously a serious matter.\n   The Soviets have had a continuing debate over whether they\nshould borrow more in the West to finance purchases of\nconsumer goods. As Keith Bush of Radio Liberty wrote on these\npages recently, Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov last year\nappeared to exaggerate the size of the Soviet external debt,\nperhaps to discourage further borrowing to fill store\nshelves. But he now appears to have lost the debate.\n   Nikolai Petrakov, Mikhail Gorbachev's chief economic\nadvisor and the lead designer of yet another planned economic\nreform, dropped a hint about foreign borrowing in a recent\ninterview with Interfax, a semi-official Soviet news agency.\nHe stressed how important it will be for President Gorbachev\nand his new cabinet to \"retain the confidence of the\npopulation\" as the new reform inflicts economic pain. He was\npresumably referring to layoffs and maybe higher prices.\n   \"It would be good, of course, if to achieve this we could\nmake use of foreign credits offered to us on easy terms,\"\nsaid Mr. Petrakov, adding that the Soviet Union \"ought to\nenter all the international economic organizations.\" In other\nwords, the Soviets would like to get into any organization\nthat has money to lend.\n   That hint is being confirmed by other reliable sources in\nWestern Europe. They say the Soviets are gearing up for a\nborrowing offensive. The question will be whether to finance\nor not finance their consumption needs.\n   At least one Westerner of some note may already have made\nup his mind on that question. U.S. Treasury Under Secretary\nDavid Mulford told a Senate hearing a few days ago that the\nU.S. would not join the proposed European Bank for\nReconstruction and Development (EBRD) if the Soviets are\ngiven full borrowing access. Western private banks also are\ntaking a more jaundiced view of Soviet credits, mainly\nbecause of mounting Soviet debt payment arrears, which are\nsaid to be approaching $1 billion. A 500 Deutsche mark ($300\nmillion) Soviet bond issue met with a cool reception on the\nLondon market in January. Keith Bush quoted a West German\nbanker as saying that the Soviet credit rating had\ndeteriorated more in a few weeks than it had in the previous\n20 years.\n   The Soviets insist that their credit problem is simply\ncaused by too many Soviet enterprises and banks having been\nturned loose to borrow in the West. Many did so without\nadequate means to service their debts. The cure, according to\nthis argument, is a recentralization of Soviet borrowing. But\nthat doesn't sound much like economic reform. Central\nmanagement is the primary source of Soviet problems.\n   Mr. Mulford obviously has a good point. If the EBRD is to\nbe set up primarily to finance redevelopment of the newly\nliberated countries of Eastern Europe, why on earth should it\nfinance Soviet consumption? Development financing presumes\nthat there will be a return on the investment. But the\nconnection between putting goods on Soviet shelves and\nachieving economic reform in that country is a tenuous one at\nbest.\n   Some use humanitarian arguments for feeding the Soviets.\nUndernourishment clearly has become serious at the lowest\nincome levels of Soviet society. It worsens as shortages and\ninflation grow. At the first meeting of his new cabinet,\nPresident Gorbachev stressed that the food situation was the\nbiggest problem facing his government.\n   But why should the West shed tears for a regime that still\nis spending huge amounts of money to build weapons and to run\na world-wide empire? Merely cutting off Fidel Castro from the\nSoviet dole or closing down the huge Soviet base at Cam Ranh\nBay, Vietnam, or scrapping one of the aircraft carriers under\nconstruction, could feed a lot of Russians.\n   Soviet militarism is part of the equation. If the Soviets\nno longer have anything to lose in the way of Western\nfinancing, will they become more aggressive toward the West?\nThat argument suggests, however, that the West should simply\nbribe the Soviets to become good guys, a doubtful enterprise\neven if it had a chance of succeeding. What in fact will\nprobably happen is that markets will make the decision. As\nthe Soviets begin to look more like bad risks, they will get\nless financing.

He said that based on prices offered by grain\nelevators and others after the figures were released Friday\nafternoon, soybean futures for November delivery could open\nfor trading about five cents a bushel lower this morning on\nthe Chicago Board of Trade.\n   On Friday, November soybean futures closed 7.25 cents\nhigher, at $6.22 a bushel. The planting figures were released\nafter the close of trading.\n   Corn futures for December delivery gained 0.75 cent a\nbushel to close at $2.5425 on the Board of Trade.\n   While no change is foreseen for corn acreage in Iowa and\nIllinois, the largest corn growing states, corn growers are\nexpected this spring to plant an additional 2.5 million acres\nelsewhere, including 300,000 acres in Nebraska, 200,000 acres\nin Minnesota and 450,000 in Ohio.\n   In a separate report on grain stocks, the Agriculture\nDepartment said corn stockpiles as of March 1 had declined 8%\nfrom a year ago to 4.81 billion bushels, and soybean\nstockpiles grew 19% to 1.06 billion bushels. Wheat stockpiles\ndropped 23% to 944 million bushels during the period.\n   The current inclination to favor corn over soybeans this\nspring reflects, among other things, a recent softening in\nsoybean futures prices as farmers and traders wait to see how\naggressively Brazilian farmers will market their newly\nharvested soybean crop, analysts said. If a recent currency\ndevaluation and other radical economic reforms force them to\nbe aggressive sellers, the resulting sag in U.S. soybean\nprices could impel American farmers to plant more corn at\nsoybeans' expense.\n   \"There are no soybeans planted yet,\" says David Asbridge,\nan American Soybean Association economist. \"Things could\nstill change.\"\n   The survey of planting intentions also shows that the\nhigher target price for corn under the government's\ncommodity-subsidy program continues to make corn more\nattractive than other less-subsidized feed grains.\n   Barley acreage is expected to fall 3% from last year to\n8.89 million acres, sorghum acreage is expected to fall 9% to\n11.5 million acres and oat acreage is expected to fall 9% to\n11 million acres.

Winter wheat accounts\nfor three-fourths of the U.S. harvest. A 4% increase would\nmore than offset the expected 12% drop in durum wheat\nplanting and a 4% drop in other spring wheat planting.\n   The decreases foreseen for sorghum and spring wheat\nacreage this year may be exaggerated, department analysts\ncautioned. Many winter wheat farmers replanted their fields\nwith spring wheat in Washington state and Idaho, and with\nsorghum in Kansas, after cold weather killed their emergent\ncrop of winter wheat.

The Lords compete in the advanced-intermediate\nlevel of a nationwide league called Hockey North America.\nParticipants spend a day a week pretending they can skate and\nshoot like Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux.\n   Since 1980, the HNA, based in Washington, D.C., has grown\nfrom 100 players to more than 12,000, in 26 cities. The\nleague attributes its success in some measure to the\ncontinuing national fitness craze. But hockey, with its\nfurious pace and bump-and-grind action, has a more basic\nappeal: \"This is not a yuppie sport,\" says Gary Poteshman,\nwho sells cutting tools and has played with the Lords for\nfive years. \"When you put on all your equipment and go out on\nthe ice, you become a totally different person. You're a\nwarrior.\"\n   Many players also are attracted to the HNA's brand of\nplay: no fighting or serious checking; that is, no slamming\nopponents into the side of the rink. The league enforces the\nrules: Each year, the HNA suspends (for from two years to\nlife) several dozen players because of excessive violence.\n   That doesn't mean HNA games are as harmless as a\nlow-impact Jane Fonda workout. Even with the no-checking\nrule, players collide in tussles for the puck. \"It's very\nphysical,\" says Max Mintzer, a tax specialist for Northern\nTrust Co. and HNA's Chicago-area coordinator. \"People are\nswatting at you. You get elbowed in the head. I've seen a\ncouple of guys break bones.\" Since its inception a decade\nago, the league has had two deaths, both from heart attacks.\n   At the beginner level, HNA takes any man or woman brave\nenough to apply. Some 10% of those who join have never\nskated. When I phone the league to ask if I can play in a\ngame, I am grilled about my experience -- not to determine if\nI can hack it, but to make sure I'm not too good. \"We don't\nwant you to go out there and mess up a game by scoring five\ngoals,\" a league official tells me. I assure him that that\nisn't likely: I'm a potato-shaped newsman who hasn't played\nice hockey since college 14 years ago. The only other thing\nthe league wants to know is more ominous: Do I have adequate\nhealth- and life-insurance?\n   The Lords' roster includes a supermarket manager, an IRS\nattorney and a district manager for Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream\nCo. The youngest player is 22; the oldest 39.\n   Before playing in my first game, I attend two team\npractices. During these sessions, our coach, Bill Christy,\nputs us through a series of passing, skating and shooting\ndrills that last about an hour. At first, my biggest obstacle\nis getting comfortable with the 25 pounds of hockey gear I\nhave to wear: elbow pads, shoulder pads, armored gloves, shin\nprotectors, padded pants and helmet. I figure if hockey\ndoesn't work out, I can always join the bomb squad. The only\nparts of me that are unprotected are the backs of my legs, my\ninner arms and my neck.\n   I feel like the Michelin Man as I skate clumsily around\nthe rink. By the second session, a week later, my feet are\ncovered with Band-Aids, but I'm skating forward and backward\nwithout feeling that I am about to capsize. The coach says\nI'm ready for my first real game, which is to be against the\nBandits.\n   Before the game -- played at 10:30 on a Tuesday night when\nnormal people are getting ready for bed -- I set what I think\nare some reasonable goals for myself: Try not to fall down\nand don't get sent to the penalty box. In general, I'll be\nsatisfied so long as I don't disgrace myself or get carried\noff the ice on a stretcher.\n   OK, I'll admit it, I also dream of skating up ice like a\nNational Hockey League star and blasting the puck past a\nterrified goalie. I realize that is a vain hope.\n   In a musty locker room before the game, Coach Christy\ndivides the team into offensive and defensive alignments.\nHockey -- even by HNA standards -- is so fast-paced that\nplayers need to be rotated on and off the ice every 90\nseconds or so to keep fresh legs in the game. The coach,\napparently doubting my potential, assigns me to the last of\nthree forward lines, each with three players. There also are\nthree pairs of defensemen.\n   As I skate out onto the ice wearing a blue and orange\nLords jersey with a lucky 7 on the back, I see spectators\nhave begun assembling for the game. Only four spectators, but\nin a moment of pre-game jitters, I trip and fall over my\nstick.\n   The action begins. Skate blades flash up and down ice,\nbodies thump against the boards -- the fencing on the\nperimeter of the playing area -- and sticks crackle on pads\nand the darting puck. Some Lords are graceful. Then there is\nBill McDermott, a 34-year-old hospital manager playing\noffense. He winds up for a big slap shot -- one of hockey's\nmost dramatic moments. On the downstroke, however, Bill's\nstick misses the puck entirely, spinning him in a\nhalf-circle. \"Hey, Bill, I could feel the breeze,\" one of the\nLords, Max Mintzer, yells from the bench.\n   The Lords first score comes when Aram Dakarian, who\nmanages a supermarket meat department, makes a nifty pass to\nGary Poteshman. This time, stick and puck connect. The black\ndisk floats into the net, and the Lords hoist their sticks to\ncelebrate the team's first goal. Players sitting on the bench\nlean over the boards and bang them with their sticks.\n   The goal ties the score 1-1, and it is now time for our\nthird line to make its first appearance. That's me.\n   As I climb nervously onto the ice, the coach grabs my\njersey and tells me to \"hang back and try to get a feel for\nthe flow of the game. See how fast you can skate. . . .\" I\ndetect some concern in his voice.\n   From the bench, an HNA game doesn't look particularly\nfrenetic. But on the ice, it takes all my energy to keep up.\nI am soon out of breath, the puck seems always to be headed\nthe other way. Toward the end of my shift, I have a brief\nchance to shoot. But just before I let go, two Bandits\nconverge and hack at me with their sticks. I feel as though I\nam caught in a threshing machine. As I struggle to stay on my\nfeet, the puck vanishes.\n   Returning to the bench, I notice steam escaping my jersey\nand coming out of the holes in my socks.\n   My second turn on the ice is more eventful. After a\nteammate passes me the puck, I maneuver around a Bandit\ndefenseman, glide toward the net and shoot. For a moment it\nlooks like the puck might actually get through, but the\ngoalie blocks the shot with his glove. \"I was robbed,\" I\nmutter to my plastic face shield.\n   In a flash, the Bandits are back on the attack in our\nzone. I try to tie up one of them in front of our goal just\nas another Bandit winds up for a slap shot. While my opponent\nand I are whacking at each other, the hard rubber puck\nricochets off the seat of my pants.\n   The bench explodes. \"Hey, Wall Street Journal. Great\ndefense,\" someone shouts.\n   Penalties become a big problem for the Lords as the game\nprogresses, as we are forced to play short one man for\nextended periods. That inspires a lecture from our coach on\nthe fine points of fouling the other team without getting\ncaught.\n   Throughout the game, both benches shout encouragement to\ntheir fellows doing battle on the rink. During one of my\nrushes, I hear the Lords loudly shouting my name. Touched, I\ntip my helmet to them, only to discover that they are just\ntrying to get me off the ice. I have played a minute past my\nline change, thus keeping one of our stars from his turn at\nplay.\n   After several scoring opportunities go awry in the third\nperiod, some Lords are feeling frustrated. \"We can't buy a\ngoal,\" our captain yells in despair. But the 1-1 deadlock is\nfinally broken when Bill McDermott redeems himself for his\nearlier whiff. Accepting a pass from Frank Winterer, a\nbanker, Bill moves in toward the net and scores.

This percentage fell to a low of 6.9%\nnear the trough of the subsequent 1969-70 recession. Since\nthen, as the chart below shows, the pattern has been for the\npercentages to be lower at both expansionary high points and\nrecessionary low points.\n                                                                                                       \n\n   The latest reading, for last year's fourth quarter, is\n5.3%. This is appreciably below the high for this expansion\nof 7.3%, set in the second quarter of 1984, but it remains\nwell above the low for the 1981-82 recession of 4.5%. It also\nis substantially higher than where Mr. Hunt, given the\npattern of progressively falling levels of both the high and\nlow readings, places the new \"recessionary range.\" For him to\nbecome concerned about profits dragging the economy into a\nrecession in coming months, he says, they would have to fall\nto about 3% of GNP.\n   Mr. Hunt shares the view of most forecasters that such a\ndecline will not occur. The consensus is that economic growth\nwill slowly accelerate as the year goes along, and in the\nprocess profits will increase. For instance, 51 forecasters\npolled by Blue Chip Economic Indicators of Sedona, Ariz.,\nestimate on average that the economy will grow 2.3% annually\nin the year's last half and profits will rise as well.\n   In the last three months of 1989, pretax profits continued\na decline that began early last year. But the rate of decline\nslowed markedly to 0.5% from 7.1% in the previous quarter.\nAnd, on an after-tax basis, profits edged up in the quarter,\nreversing a yearlong slide.\n   Profits, it should be noted, tend to lead the economy's\nups and downs. The government, in fact, continues to classify\nthem as a leading economic indicator, normally rising or\nfalling several months before such broader gauges as\nemployment and industrial production follow suit. Mr. Hunt\nagrees that profits still tend to lead the economy, but he\nadds that nowadays \"the economy clearly can manage to keep\nexpanding through the sort of profit decline that once would\nhave signaled a recession.\"\n   One reason, he says, is that service businesses, which\ntend to operate on slimmer profit margins, now play a larger\neconomic role. More importantly, the huge increase in\ncorporate indebtedness in recent years has served to reduce\nprofits. Corporations' net interest costs -- interest expense\nless interest income -- reached a record 52% of profits in\nlast year's fourth quarter, up from less than 2% a\nquarter-century ago.\n                                                                                                       \n\n   The interest that corporations pay on their bonds and\nother borrowings, of course, may be deducted from their\nprofits, reducing taxes. The upshot is that many firms that\nhave undergone leveraged restructuring now show weak profits\nor lose money, and yet remain in operation, providing jobs\nthat help sustain overall economic activity.\n                                                                                                       \n\n   The economy, to be sure, cannot continue indefinitely to\nexpand if profits keep dropping. Many analysts, in fact,\nattribute much of the economy's recent sluggishness to the\nprofit decline of the past year and its impact on corporate\nhiring and spending. And some forecasters remain convinced\nthe profit decline signals a recession is near.\n   Perhaps so. But with a reduced role for profits, that\npossibility may prove less likely than in the past.", "id": "\n900402-0089.", "title": "\n   The Outlook:\n   Impact of Profit Drop\n   May Have Lessened\n   ----\n   By Alfred L.

That result\ncompares with $26 in the fourth quarter of 1989 and $39 a ton\nin last year's robust first quarter.\n   Among major steelmakers, USX Corp. appears to have fared\nthe best in the latest period, partly reflecting the\ncompany's labor cost advantages. Analysts predict that the\nPittsburgh steel and energy concern should earn between 55\nand 60 cents a share compared with a $1.09 a year ago.\n   Most major steelmakers, except for USX, had higher\nfirst-quarter labor costs stemming from new labor pacts\nnegotiated last year. Bethlehem Steel Corp., the first major\nsteelmaker to sign a contract last year, is expected to earn\nabout 15 cents a share in the latest quarter compared with 78\ncents last year.\n   The automotive sector, which consumes about 23% of U.S.\nmills' output, was weak through much of the quarter, picking\nup toward the end. As a result, steelmakers, such as National\nSteel Corp., that are largely dependent on auto-related\ncustomers are expected to fare badly. Analysts expect\nNational Steel, a Pittsburgh joint venture owned by National\nIntergroup Inc. and NKK Corp. of Japan, to earn about $12 a\nton.\n   The outlook for the rest of the year is mixed. Mr.\nJacobson said he initially thought the steel industry would\nsuffer at least two quarterly losses in 1990. But now he\nexpects a quicker upturn as prices begin to climb. \"I think\nwe're pretty much out of the woods,\" he said.\n   Other analysts, though, expect the lackluster first\nquarter to persist through 1990. \"Look for anemic profits in\n1990\" said Peter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. He\ncited flat shipments, higher labor costs and continuing price\nweakness as reasons for the slump.\n   Some analysts, such as John Tumazos of Donaldson, Lufkin &\nJenrette, believe softness in automotive and construction\nmarkets will extend to the previously strong capital goods\nmarket. \"Historically, after the consumer segment is weak for\ntwo to four quarters, the capital goods market begins to\nease,\" he said.\n   Steelmakers suffered from lower prices in the first\nquarter, a trend that began in the second half of 1989. Mr.\nTumazos said average first-quarter prices fell to $491 a ton\nfrom $503 a ton in the fourth quarter. \"I don't think the\npublic will be aware of how deep the discounts were until\nthey see the first-quarter results,\" he said.\n   Price declines have been most severe for commodity-type\nproducts such as hot rolled sheet. Mr. Marcus noted that the\nbase spot price for that product fell to about $310 a ton\nfrom $325 in the fourth quarter and $400 a ton last spring.\nMoreover, world spot prices for even high quality products\nlike cold rolled sheet recently fell an additional $40 a ton,\npartly as a result of overproduction, Mr. Marcus said.\n   Those steelmakers with more long-term contracts and less\nexposure to the spot market, such as Armco Inc., Parsippany,\nN.J., and Chicago-based Inland Steel Industries Inc., are\nless vulnerable to spot price discounting.\n   Also hurting first-quarter results, noted analyst\nChristopher Plummer of WEFA Group, were lower operating\nrates. Those rates were about 82% in the first quarter\ncompared with the year-earlier quarter's 90%. As a result,\nfixed interest and labor costs were spread over fewer tons of\nsteel shipped. \"It's enough of a drop to have a significant\nimpact on earnings,\" he said.\n   Still, shipments held up relatively well in the quarter\ndespite the lackluster economy. One reason was the low level\nof imports. First-quarter shipments should total about 20\nmillion tons, slightly higher than the fourth quarter but\nlower than the 1989 first quarter's 21.9 million tons. The\nstrength in shipments is expected to continue in the second\nquarter as buyers rebuild inventories, a move that should\nalso relieve some pressure on pricing.", "id": "\n900402-0012.", "title": "\n   Big Steelmakers\n   To Report Drop\n   In 1st-Period Net\n   ---\n   Some Producers May Post\n   Losses, Analysts Warn;\n   Price Erosion Continues\n   ----\n   By Clare Ansberry\n   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal"}, "doc\n900402-0163.": {"content": "", "id": "\n900402-0163.", "title": "\n   Who's News:\n   Network Systems Corp."}, "doc\n900402-0064.": {"content": "\n   Built in 1972, the structure is an award-winning example\nof suspension-bridge architecture.
